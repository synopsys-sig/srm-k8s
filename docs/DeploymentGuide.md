# Software Risk Manager Features

The footprint of your Software Risk Manager Kubernetes deployment depends on the licensed features you plan to use. Some features depend on external systems you must configure separately, while others optionally depend on external components. The following sections include feature-related deployment diagrams. Since the parts are additive, you can conflate diagrams to see the entire footprint for your selected feature set.

## Core Feature

The Software Risk Manager web application requires a MariaDB (version 10.6.x) or a MySQL (version 8.0.x) database instance. You can provide a database instance or use what's included in the Software Risk Manager Helm chart. We treat a database you provide as an external one that you are responsible for configuring according to our guidance. An external database can be a standalone instance or one managed on your behalf by a cloud provider like AWS or Azure. A Core deployment using an external database consists of one Software Risk Manager pod.

![Core with External Database](images/diagram-core-external-db.png "Core with External Database")

A Core deployment without an external database includes additional pods for the primary and optional secondary database instances. The MariaDB database instances store data using Kubernetes Persistent Volumes. The web application connects to the primary database instance. Data gets replicated to an optional secondary database instance that supports backups using a script that invokes mariabackup with the option to pause replica SQL threads. The Software Risk Manager Helm chart configures on-cluster database instance(s).

![Core with Replica Database](images/diagram-core-replica-db.png "Core with Replica Database")

Every Software Risk Manager includes the web application that serves the web UI. Additional feature installation will depend on licensing and your Software Risk Manager use case.

## Scan Farm Feature

Deployments that include the Scan Farm feature have built-in SAST and SCA scanning provided by Coverity and Black Duck, respectively. They include additional pods that support scanning, caching, and storage with external dependencies on PostgreSQL (versions 10.16 - 14.x), Redis (version 5.0 or greater), and object storage provided by either GCP, AWS, Azure, or MinIO. You are responsible for configuring external dependencies according to our guidance.

Your Software Risk Manager licensing will determine whether you have SAST, SCA, or both SAST and SCA scanning capability. SCA scanning depends on an external Black Duck server instance hosted by Synopsys. You are not responsible for the configuration of this instance or for specifying its endpoint during the Software Risk Manager deployment process.

Scan Farm-related Docker images are unavailable in Docker Hub. You must pull them along with all other Software Risk Manager Docker images from the Synopsys Software Integrity Group repository (sig-repo.synopsys.com).

![Scan Farm](images/diagram-scan-farm.png "Scan Farm")

The Scan Farm includes an ingress resource for the following services: Storage Service, Cache Service, and Scan Service. The Storage Service provides access to externally provided object storage, the Cache Service provides an interface to an external cache, and the Scan Service provides the Tool API that lets clients download SAST and SCA tools.

The external, Synopsys-provided Black Duck SCA scanning endpoint will receive a Black Duck BDIO file used for Black Duck Rapid Scans. The file gets sent to a Synopsys Code Sight endpoint and is then handled by Black Duck server and Black Duck KnowledgeBase instances. For general [communication with Black Duck services](https://sig-product-docs.synopsys.com/bundle/bd-hub/page/Network_Communications/CommunicationWithBDServers.html) information, refer to the Black Duck documentation.

## Tool Orchestration Feature

Deployments that include the Tool Orchestration feature support orchestrated analyses that let you run both built-in and custom [add-ins](https://github.com/codedx/srm-add-ins) on your cluster. They have additional pods that support tool workflows and storage with an optional external dependency on object storage provided by a system with an AWS S3-compatible API (e.g., MinIO, AWS S3, GCS, etc.). 

![Tool Orchestration External Components](images/diagram-tool-orchestration-external.png "Tool Orchestration External Components")

When not opting for external object storage, the Software Risk Manager Helm chart will configure an older MinIO version for you.

# Requirements

Refer to what follows for the supported or tested versions of software that comprise the Software Risk Manager deployment.

## Kubernetes Requirements

The Software Risk Manager deployment supports Kubernetes versions 1.22 through 1.30 and was tested with OpenShift 4.13. If you are not a cluster administrator, your cluster access must include the permissions defined in the sections below before installing Software Risk Manager on your cluster.

### Kubernetes Privileges for Core Feature Deployment

The required Kubernetes privileges for the Core feature deployment will depend on whether or not you use an external database. For external database deployments, refer to the [admin-core-external-db-deployment-role](./roles/admin-core-external-db-deployment-role.yaml) ClusterRole definition. Otherwise, refer to the [admin-core-deployment-role](./roles/admin-core-deployment-role.yaml) ClusterRole definition.

You can use a role YAML file to assign privileges required at deployment time. For example, if you plan to deploy the Core feature using an external database by logging on to your cluster as `user1`, you can do the following:

As a cluster admin, create a ClusterRole resource using the `admin-core-external-db-deployment-role.yaml` file:

```
$ kubectl apply -f /path/to/git/srm-k8s/docs/roles/admin-core-external-db-deployment-role.yaml
```

As a cluster admin, create a ClusterRoleBinding resource:

```
$ kubectl create clusterrolebinding admin-core-external-db-deployment-role-binding --clusterrole=admin-core-external-db-deployment-role --user=user1
```

You can now log on to the cluster as `user1` and deploy the Core feature with an external database.

### Kubernetes Privileges for Scan Farm Feature Deployment

The [required Kubernetes privileges for the Scan Farm feature deployment](https://sig-product-docs.synopsys.com/bundle/coverity-docs/page/cnc/topics/infrastructure_prerequisites.html) are documented externally under the `Access privileges` section.

### Kubernetes Privileges for Tool Orchestration Feature Deployment

The required Kubernetes privileges for the Tool Orchestration feature deployment will depend on whether or not you use an external database. For external database deployments, refer to the [admin-tool-orchestration-external-db-deployment-role](./roles/admin-tool-orchestration-external-db-deployment-role.yaml) ClusterRole definition. Otherwise, refer to the [admin-tool-orchestration-deployment-role](./roles/admin-tool-orchestration-deployment-role.yaml) ClusterRole definition.

You can use a role YAML file to assign privileges required at deployment time. For example, if you plan to deploy the Tool Orchestration feature using an external database by logging on to your cluster as `user1`, you can do the following:

As a cluster admin, create a ClusterRole resource using the `admin-tool-orchestration-external-db-deployment-role.yaml` file:

```
$ kubectl apply -f /path/to/git/srm-k8s/docs/roles/admin-tool-orchestration-external-db-deployment-role.yaml
```

As a cluster admin, create a ClusterRoleBinding resource:

```
$ kubectl create clusterrolebinding admin-tool-orchestration-external-db-deployment-role-binding --clusterrole=admin-tool-orchestration-external-db-deployment-role --user=user1
```

You can now log on to the cluster as `user1` and deploy the Tool Orchestration feature with an external database.

## Helm Requirements

The Software Risk Manager deployment requires [helm](https://github.com/helm/helm/releases) version 3.8.0 or later.

## System Size

Although we often get asked what the hardware requirements are, there is no one answer since it largely depends on how many Software Risk Manager projects will be active at the same time, how frequently analyses will be conducted, whether built-in tools are being used, the number of results from tools in use, how many concurrent users are expected to use the system, and what other system interactions might be configured. Taking that into account, you can use some general guidelines to determine the size of your deployment.

| Size | Total Projects | Daily Analyses | Concurrent Analyses |
|:-|-:|-:|-:|
|Small|1 - 100|1,000|8|
|Medium|100 - 2,000|2,000|16|
|Large|2,000 - 10,000|10,000|32|
|Extra Large|10,000+|10,000+|64|

The Helm Prep Wizard (see [Full Installation](#installation---full)) includes a screen where you can specify the system size:

![Helm Prep Wizard Size](images/helm-prep-wizard-size.png "Helm Prep Wizard Size")

And the Helm Prep script will use the system size to set the `sizing.size` Helm values setting, and it will also configure any dependency charts according to the specified size. [Quick Starts](#installation---quick-start) use Unspecified, so they do not support automatic component sizing.

>Note: The system sizing capability does not apply to Scan Farm workloads.

The default system size is Unspecified. A system size specification will override most configurable resource requests. If you want to use specific resource requests, keep the `sizing.size` chart parameter at its default value.

## Core Feature Requirements

This section describes the web and web database requirements based on the system size.

### Core Web Workload Requirements

| Size | CPU Cores | Memory | IOPs | Storage |
|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|
|Small|4|16 GB|3,000|64 GB|
|Medium|8|32 GB|6,000|128 GB|
|Large|16|64 GB|12,000|256 GB|
|Extra Large|32|128 GB|32,000|512 GB|

### Core Web Database Workload Requirements

| Size | CPU Cores | Memory | IOPs | Storage |
|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|
|Small|4|16 GB|3,000|192 GB|
|Medium|8|32 GB|6,000|384 GB|
|Large|16|64 GB|12,000|768 GB|
|Extra Large|32|128 GB|32,000|1536 GB|

### Core Web Replica Database Workload Requirements

The replica database is an optional component when using the on-cluster MariaDB component.

| Size | CPU Cores | Memory | IOPs | Storage | Backup Storage |
|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|
|Small|2|8 GB|3,000|192 GB|576 GB|
|Medium|4|16 GB|6,000|384 GB|1152 GB|
|Large|8|32 GB|12,000|768 GB|2304 GB|
|Extra Large|16|64 GB|32,000|1536 GB|4608 GB|

### Core Persistent Storage Requirements

The Software Risk Manager web workload requires a Persistent Volume resource to store various files: the analysis inputs it receives, including the source code it displays on the Finding Details page, log files, and configuration files, to include data required to decrypt certain database records. By default, the volume will be provisioned dynamically at deployment time. The optional on-cluster MariaDB database usage determines whether additional, dynamically-provisioned Persistent Volume resources are needed.

| Volume | Feature | Description |
|:-|:-:|:-:|
| Web AppData | Core | Required volume for web workload |
| Primary DB Data | Core (w/ On-Cluster Database) | Database volume for primary database |
| Replica DB Data | Core (w/ On-Cluster Database) | Database volume for replica database |
| Replica DB Backup | Core (w/ On-Cluster Database) | Database volume for replica database backups |

### Core Internet Access Requirements

Software Risk Manager uses internet access in the background for some activities, such as keeping tool data up-to-date and periodically checking for a new Software Risk Manager release.

Software Risk Manager does not require internet access; however, internet access is highly recommended to ensure full functionality.

To disable background internet access by Software Risk Manager, [customize your Software Risk Manager deployment](#customizing-software-risk-manager) by setting `codedx.offline-mode = true`. The default is false. Note that this will not disable any internet access that may occur due to user action or configuration settings, such as Tool Connector, Git, or Issue Tracker configurations.

When internet access is enabled, Software Risk Manager will perform the following actions:

- Update notifications - Software Risk Manager will periodically check for newer versions and display an update notification when one is available. Requests for the latest version are sent to https://service.codedx.com/updates/latestVersionData.json.
- Dependency-Check updates - Dependency-Check will periodically download updates from the National Vulnerability Database, the Retire.js repository, or reach out to Maven Central while scanning Java dependencies (this aids in the dependency identification process, to cut down on both false positive and false negative results). 
- If Software Risk Manager is in offline mode, this may lead to lower quality results when running Dependency-Check as a bundled tool.
- Secure Code Warrior - Unless noted elsewhere, Software Risk Manager will reach out to any URLs belonging to the securecodewarrior.com domain.

### Core Pod Security Admission Requirements

When enforcing policy violations with the optional [Kubernetes Pod Security Admission](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-admission) feature, the Core feature requires the `baseline` level.

## Scan Farm Feature Requirements

This section covers the requirements you must satisfy with the external dependencies you provide for the database, cache, and object storage layers.

### Scan Farm Database Requirements

The Scan Farm feature depends on a PostgreSQL database supporting versions 12 to 15, including all minor versions. Synopsys recommends using a DBaaS (database as a service) database. Configure your PostgreSQL database by reserving 1 CPU core and 2 GB RAM. The recommended database volume size is 5GB.

### Scan Farm Cache Requirements

Here are the requirements and recommendations for your Redis instance:

- Redis must be configured without eviction. You must ensure the Redis eviction policy is set to noeviction (maxmemory-policy=noeviction). The Cache Service design requires that all metadata be resident in Redis at all times. The Cache Service will refuse to start if Redis is not correctly configured.

- The Redis memory limit should be 1 GB. The Cache Service checks the memory usage of the Redis server at start-up and will not start if memory usage is more than 99% of the server limit.

- The Cache Service does not use Redis persistence; therefore, configure Redis without persistence. If persistence is enabled, the Redis pod memory limit must be significantly higher than the Redis server memory limit.

- Your Redis instance must permit network traffic from the Cache Service.

- Allocate 1 vCPU for on-cluster Redis workloads.

Synopsys recommends configuring your Redis instance with both authentication and TLS.

### Scan Farm Object Storage Requirements

The Scan Farm requires two buckets that must be created before deployment. A storage bucket would be considered a blob container when using Azure object storage.

The first bucket supports the Scan Service, and the second the Cache Service. The overall size requirements for Scan Service storage depend on scanning activity and retention period.

| Object Type | Average Size | Average Number of Scans | Retention Period | Total Average Size |
|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|
| Scan Objects | M GB | N | T days | (M \* N \* T) GB |
| Client CLI Tools | 10 GB | n/a | 1 Release | 10 GB |
| Logs | 500 MB | n/a | T days | T/2 GB |

For example, if:
M = 0.25 GB per scan
N = 100 scans per day
T = 30-day retention period
CLI tools use 10 GB in total
Logs are .5 GB each
Using the equation: (M \* N \* T) GB + 10GB + T/2 GB

The total Scan Service storage bucket size is 750 GB (scan objects) + 10 GB (CLI tools) + 15 GB (logs) = 775 GB

>Note: Do not set an object expiration/deletion policy on the storage bucket.

The Cache Service bucket should not be geographically distributed and should not enable versioning, retention, or other special features. 

You must configure your Cache Service bucket with an object expiration greater than (not equal to) 7 days. When creating a life cycle policy on Azure, define the policy using the last modified date, not the creation date. The Cache Service checks that this lifecycle rule is present and will not start if a lifecycle policy retention period is not set.

Both buckets must support read/write access from the Cache Service and Storage Service. Additionally, the Cache Service must have permission to download the cache bucket's lifecycle policy. For example, with storage that supports the S3 API, the Cache Service will use the GetBucketLifecycleConfiguration API, which requires the s3:GetLifecycleConfiguration permission.

### Scan Farm Node Pool Requirements

The Scan Farm requires a separate node pool that supports nodes with 6.5 vCPUs and 26 GB of RAM. Meeting this requirement in your infrastructure might require a node pool of 8 vCPU and 32 GB RAM nodes. The nodes must include a Kubernetes taint for NodeType​=​​ScannerNode and a label of pool-type​=​small. A SAST analysis will consume a single node, so you should configure your node pool to scale horizontally as your scanning workload requires.

### Scan Farm Network Ports

The Software Risk Manager web pod communicates with Scan Farm pods using port 9998, and the Scan Farm pods communicate with the web pod using port 8080. For a complete list of network ports, refer to the Software Risk Manager chart and script resources:

- [Core NetworkPolicy](../chart/templates/networkpolicy.yaml)
- [Scan Farm Egress Ports](../ps/build/netpol.ps1)

>Note: If you also use the Tool Orchestration feature, refer to the [Tool Orchestration NetworkPolicy](../chart/templates/to-networkpolicy.yaml).

### Scan Farm Private Registry

When you enable the Scan Farm feature, you must pull Software Risk Manager Docker images from the Synopsys SIG (Software Integrity Group) private Docker registry (SIG repo) and push them to your private registry. This includes the Docker images for all the features you plan to install, not just Scan Farm-related ones. 

You can use a private registry hosted by a cloud provider (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure, etc.) or deploy your own (see [registry.md](deploy/registry.md) for details).

### Scan Farm Ingress Requirements

The Scan Farm feature requires you to use an ingress controller, and your ingress controller must support multiple ingress resources referencing the same hostname. Synopsys recommends the [NGINX Community](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/) ingress controller. You can find the Installation Guide [here](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/deploy/).

### Scan Farm Internet Access Requirements

SCA scanning depends on an external Black Duck system hosted by Synopsys at `https://codesight.synopsys.com`. SCA scans will fail if this endpoint is inaccessible from your cluster.

The Scan Service also depends on the Synopsys SIG Repo hosted at sig-repo.synopsys.com. The service downloads Scan Farm components at boot time and will not work correctly without a SIG Repo connection.

### Scan Farm Default Pod Resources

Below are the default CPU and memory assigned to Scan Farm pods.

| Pod | CPU | Memory |
|:-|:-:|:-:|
| Scan Service                     | 100m  |   128Mi |
| Cache Service                    | 500m  |  1000Mi |
| Storage Service                  | 100m  |   128Mi |
| SAST Scan Job                    | 6500m | 26000Mi |
| SCA Scan Job (buildless scan)    | 1500m |  1500Mi |
| SCA Scan Job (Bridge-based scan) | 1500m |   500Mi |

>Note: Refer to the [Scan Farm Job Resources](#scan-farm-job-resources) section for how to customize resource requirements for Scan Farm jobs.

## Tool Orchestration Feature Requirements

The initial MinIO volume size should be 64 GB when not using external object storage. External object storage can be provided by any storage system that supports an AWS S3-compliant API (e.g., AWS, GCP, MinIO, etc.).

### Tool Service Workload Requirements

| Size | CPU Cores | Memory | Replicas
|:-|-:|-:|-:|
|Small|1|1024 Mi|1|
|Medium|2|2048 Mi|2|
|Large|2|2048 Mi|3|
|Extra Large|2|2048 Mi|4|

### Workflow Controller Workload Requirements

| Size | CPU Cores | Memory
|:-|-:|-:|
|Small|.5|500 Mi|
|Medium|1|1000 Mi|
|Large|2|1500 Mi|
|Extra Large|4|2000 Mi|

### On-Cluster Workflow Storage Requirements (MinIO)

The MinIO pod is not applicable when using external workflow object storage (e.g., AWS S3).

| Size | CPU Cores | Memory | Storage
|:-|-:|-:|-:|
|Small|2|5120 Mi|64 GB|
|Medium|4|10240 Mi|128 GB|
|Large|8|20480 Mi|256 GB|
|Extra Large|16|40960 Mi|512 GB|

### Add-in Tool Workload Requirements

Deployments that include the Tool Orchestration feature support orchestrated analyses that let you run both built-in and custom [add-ins](https://github.com/codedx/srm-add-ins) on your cluster. Refer to the [Tool Orchestration Add-in Resource Requirements](#tool-orchestration-add-in-resource-requirements) section for add-in tool pod resources that you can set on a global, tool, project, or project tool basis.

By default, add-in tools use a 500m CPU request with a 2000m CPU limit and make a request for 500Mi memory with a 2G limit.

### Tool Orchestration Persistent Storage Requirements

When using Tool Orchestration without external object storage, a single, dynamically-provisioned Persistent Volume resource is required for orchestrated analysis workflow storage, including analysis inputs, results, and related tool log files. Refer to the [On-Cluster Workflow Storage Requirements](#on-cluster-workflow-storage-requirements) section for default volume capacity based on system size.

By default, Software Risk Manager will automatically remove old analyses and related storage from the tool service. Related tool results and findings will be retained when workflow storage gets cleaned up. Workflow cleanup is enabled by default, allowing storage for 100 completed analyses to exist in a success or failure state, with a maximum of five completed analyses per project.

Additional analyses beyond the limits will remove the storage for the oldest analysis. To adjust workflow cleanup behavior, [customize your Software Risk Manager deployment](#customizing-software-risk-manager) by setting these parameters:

```
- tws.storage.cleanup.enabled = true
- tws.storage.cleanup.max-total-analyses = 100
- tws.storage.cleanup.max-analyses-per-project = 5
```

You can use this expression to estimate your maximum workflow storage requirement:

```
(tws.storage.cleanup.max-total-analyses * average-analysis-input-size) +
(tws.storage.cleanup.max-total-analyses * average-analysis-result-size) +
(tws.storage.cleanup.max-total-analyses * average-tool-log-size)
```

You can use this expression to estimate your workflow storage requirement for completed analyses when the total analysis count is less than tws.storage.cleanup.max-total-analyses:

```
(tws.storage.cleanup.max-analyses-per-project * project-count * average-analysis-input-size) +
(tws.storage.cleanup.max-analyses-per-project * project-count * average-analysis-result-size) +
(tws.storage.cleanup.max-analyses-per-project * project-count * average-tool-log-size)
```

### Tool Orchestration Add-in Resource Requirements

Software Risk Manager can create orchestrated analyses that run one or more application security testing tools where each tool has access to its host's memory and CPU resources. Using Kubernetes tools, you can control the memory and CPU capacity available for analyses. You can also improve Kubernetes scheduling outcomes by requesting CPU or memory capacity for specific tools or projects. Resource requirements can also include a node selector and pod toleration, with taint effects NoSchedule and NoExecute, to influence further where tools run on your cluster.

The resource requirements feature cannot be configured using the Software Risk Manager user interface, but you can use the kubectl command to define configuration maps (ConfigMaps) that cover specific scopes determined by a special naming convention. The tool service will look for and read optional ConfigMaps to determine how resource requirements apply to a particular tool run.

Resource requirements containing CPU and memory instructions translate to Kubernetes resource requests and limits and fit with any other related Kubernetes configuration, such as a resource limit defined for a Kubernetes namespace. You can specify resource requirement data by using the following ConfigMap field names:

- requests.cpu – Kubernetes CPU request (e.g., 1).
- requests.memory – Kubernetes memory request (e.g., 1G).
- limits.cpu – Kubernetes CPU limit (e.g., 2).
- limits.memory – Kubernetes memory limit (e.g., 2G).
- nodeSelectorKey – key portion of a label associated with a node selector (e.g., purpose).
- nodeSelectorValue – value portion of a label associated with a node selector.
- podTolerationKey – key portion of a taint with the NoSchedule and NoExecute taint effects (e.g., dedicated).
- podTolerationValue – value portion of a taint with the NoSchedule and NoExecute taint effects (e.g., tools).

Below are the default CPU and memory settings for add-in tools. Refer to the [Tool Orchestration Add-in Tool Configuration](#tool-orchestration-add-in-tool-configuration) section for how to customize resource requirements for your Software Risk Manager deployment.

| Resource | Request | Limit |
|:-|:-:|:-:|
| CPU | 500m | 2000m |
| Memory | 500Mi | 2G |

>Note: There are no defaults for add-in node selectors and pod tolerations.

### Tool Orchestration Pod Security Admission Requirements

When enforcing policy violations with the optional [Kubernetes Pod Security Admission](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-admission) feature, the Tool Orchestration feature requires the `privileged` level.

# External Web Database Pre-work

Software Risk Manager includes a MariaDB database that requires no configuration on your part. You can skip this section if you plan to use the on-cluster database instance.

If you prefer an external database, the web workload supports MariaDB version 10.6.x and MySQL version 8.0.x. Complete the following pre-work before installing Software Risk Manager with an external web database.

Your MariaDB/MySQL database must include the following variable configuration.

- optimizer_search_depth=0
- character_set_server=utf8mb4
- collation_server=utf8mb4_general_ci
- lower_case_table_names=1
- log_bin_trust_function_creators=1

The log_bin_trust_function_creators parameter is required when using replication, enabled by default with the AWS MariaDB/MySQL Production template.

If you are using a database instance hosted by AWS, Azure, or GCP, refer to [how to create a new AWS parameter group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_WorkingWithParamGroups.html), [how to configure Azure Database for MySQL parameters](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/mysql/single-server/how-to-server-parameters), or [how to configure GCP Cloud SQL MySQL database flags](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/flags).

Refer to the Web Database Workload Requirements section for database instance configuration details. You must pre-create the database catalog and the Software Risk Manager database user with the following steps.

>Note: If you have to reinstall Software Risk Manager and purge your Software Risk Manager data, you must repeat Steps 2 and 3 after deleting your Software Risk Manager Persistent Volume.

1. Create a database user. You can customize the following statement to create a user named "srm," remove 'REQUIRE SSL' when not using TLS (your database instance may require transport security).

   CREATE USER 'srm'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'enter-a-password-here' REQUIRE SSL;

2. Create a database catalog. The following statement creates a catalog named srmdb.

   CREATE DATABASE srmdb;

3. Grant required privileges on the database catalog to the database user you created. The following statements grant permissions to the srm database user.

   GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, CREATE TEMPORARY TABLES, ALTER, REFERENCES, INDEX, DROP, TRIGGER ON srmdb.* to 'srm'@'%';
   FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

4. If your database configuration requires Software Risk Manager to trust a certificate (e.g., the [Amazon RDS root certificate](https://s3.amazonaws.com/rds-downloads/rds-ca-2019-root.pem)), download the certificate to make it available later in the Helm Prep Wizard.

Using an external database with TLS is recommended. If you plan to use an unencrypted connection to an external MySQL database with the `caching_sha2_password` default_authentication_plugin, refer to [Specify MySQL Server Public Key Path](#specify-mysql-server-public-key-path).

# Persistent Storage Pre-work

Software Risk Manager depends on one or more Persistent Volume resources, depending on the features you install and how you configure them. You will always have at least one volume for the Core feature's web component. Dynamic volume provisioning is required by default. Refer to the following sections for Kubernetes provider-specific instructions.

## Volume Configuration Pre-work

Consider using Persistent Volumes with a [Retain reclaim policy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#retain). Volumes associated with a [Delete reclaim policy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#delete) will be lost if a Persistent Volume Claim is inadvertently deleted. Dynamic volume provisioning will use the [reclaim policy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/storage-classes/#reclaim-policy) specified by the [storage class](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/storage-classes/#the-storageclass-resource).

>Note: You can edit Persistent Volume resources to change the retention policy of existing volumes.

Should volume resizing be necessary in the future, consider using Persistent Volumes that [allow volume expansion](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/storage-classes/#allow-volume-expansion).

## AWS Persistent Storage Pre-work

Software Risk Manager supports EBS and EFS storage volumes for the web workload. Do not use AWS EFS for database-related volumes.

### AWS EBS Persistent Storage Pre-work

If you plan to use AWS EBS storage, install the [AWS EBS CSI Driver EKS Addon](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/eks-add-ons.html) before continuing.

### AWS EFS Persistent Storage Pre-work

This section describes using AWS EFS storage for your Software Risk Manager Web volume. The AWS EFS CSI driver supports dynamic provisioning. This example uses static provisioning and demonstrates how the Software Risk Manager chart can reference a bound Persistent Volume Claim resource.

>Note: These steps assume that you are using the Software Risk Manager Core feature with an external database. 

1) Create and configure an [EFS filesystem](https://aws.amazon.com/pm/efs). Ensure that available network mounts exist in each Availability Zone before continuing and that inbound network rules permit network traffic on port 2049 from your cluster workloads.

2) Install the [AWS EFS CSI Driver EKS Addon](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/eks-add-ons.html)

3) Save this StorageClass content to a file named efs-storageclass.yaml:

```
kind: StorageClass
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: efs-sc
provisioner: efs.csi.aws.com
```

4) Create the StorageClass resource with the following command:

```
kubectl apply -f ./efs-storageclass.yaml
```

5) Replace the \<volume-handle-id\> (e.g., fs-07b385603296a82db) placeholder and save the below YAML to a file named srm-web-appdata-pv.yaml:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: srm-web-appdata
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 1Gi
  volumeMode: Filesystem
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteMany
  persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Retain
  storageClassName: efs-sc
  csi:
    driver: efs.csi.aws.com
    volumeHandle: <volume-handle-id>
```

6) Create the PersistentVolume resource with the following command:

```
kubectl apply -f ./srm-web-appdata-pv.yaml
```

7) Create the Software Risk Manager namespace, replacing the namespace name as necessary:

```
kubectl create ns srm
```

8) Save this PersistentVolumeClaim content to a file named srm-web-appdata-pvc.yaml, replacing the namespace name as necessary:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: srm-web-appdata
  namespace: srm
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteMany
  storageClassName: efs-sc
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi
```

9) Create the PersistentVolumeClaim resource with the following command:

```
kubectl apply -f ./srm-web-appdata-pvc.yaml
```

10) Wait for the PersistentVolumeClaim to reach a Bound status, check by periodically running the following command, replacing the namespace name as necessary:

```
kubectl -n srm get pvc srm-web-appdata
```

11) Save this Job content to a file named srm-web-appdata-job.yaml, replacing the namespace name as necessary:

```
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job 
metadata:
  name: srm-web-appdata
  namespace: srm
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: srm-web-appdata
        image: busybox
        command: ["/bin/sh"]
        args: ["-c", "cd /data && chmod 2775 . && chown root:1000 ."]
        volumeMounts:
        - name: srm-web-appdata-storage
          mountPath: /data
      restartPolicy: Never
      volumes:
      - name: srm-web-appdata-storage
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: srm-web-appdata
```

12) Create the Job resource with the following command:

```
kubectl apply -f ./srm-web-appdata-job.yaml
```

13) Wait for the Job to complete, check by periodically running the following command, replacing the namespace name as necessary:

```
kubectl -n srm get job srm-web-appdata
```

14) If you already have an srm-extra-props.yaml file, merge the below content into your existing file. Otherwise, create your srm-extra-props.yaml file (see [Customizing Software Risk Manager](#customizing-software-risk-manager)) and add the following content:

```
web:
  persistence:
    existingClaim: srm-web-appdata
```

15) Refer to [Customizing Software Risk Manager](#customizing-software-risk-manager) for how to rerun helm with your srm-extra-props.yaml file.
 
# Scan Farm Pre-work

Software Risk Manager does not include the dependencies required for the Scan Farm features. You can skip this section if you do not plan to use the Scan Farm feature. Complete the following pre-work before installing the Scan Farm.

## Private Docker Registry

When using the Scan Farm feature, you must have access to a private registry where you will store Software Risk Manager Docker images. Determine whether your private registry requires a Kubernetes Image Pull Secret. Your private registry may not require an explicit username and password if your cluster's configuration already includes access. If you need a registry credential, identify the username and password, but do not pre-create the Kubernetes Image Pull Secret.

Determine whether you will use a prefix for repositories added to your private registry. Your registry may require one, or you may create one to simplify pushing Docker images by pre-creating a single repository. For example, if you use Google Cloud Platform Artifact Registry in the us-central1 region, your registry host will be us-central1-docker.pkg.dev, but your repository prefix could be my-gcp-project-name/srm (assuming a GCP project named "my-gcp-project-name"). In that case, you should pre-create the srm repository before pushing Docker images from SIG repo to us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/my-gcp-project-name/srm.

You can find instructions for pulling the latest Software Risk Manager Docker images for Scan Farm deployments [here](deploy/registry.md).

## AWS Scan Farm Pre-work

You can satisfy Scan Farm feature dependencies with AWS services.

### EKS Scanner Nodes Pre-work

Create a new [EKS node group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/create-managed-node-group.html) for your Scan Farm nodes. Select an instance type that includes 8 vCPUs and 32 GiB of RAM. 

![EKS Node Group](images/aws-node-group.png "EKS Node Group")

In the "Kubernetes label" section, add a label with Key=pool-type and Value=small.

![EKS Node Group Label](images/aws-node-group-label.png "EKS Node Group Label")

In the "Kubernetes taint" section, add a taint with Key=NodeType, Value=ScannerNode, and Effect=NoSchedule.

![EKS Node Group Taint](images/aws-node-group-taint.png "EKS Node Group Taint")

### RDS for PostgreSQL (Database) Pre-work

Create a new [RDS for PostgreSQL database](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/postgresql) instance to host the Scan Farm's database catalogs for the Scan Service and Storage Service.

![AWS PostgreSQL](images/aws-postgresql.png "AWS PostgreSQL")

Allocate storage capacity and specify an instance size that meets the CPU and memory requirements in the Scan Farm Database Requirements section.

![AWS PostgreSQL Instance](images/aws-postgresql-instance.png "AWS PostgreSQL Instance")

Your PostgreSQL database instance must permit network traffic from the Storage Service and Scan Service pods. For example, if your database is in the same VPC as your EKS cluster, update your RDS security group by adding your EKS cluster security group.

![AWS PostgreSQL Network](images/aws-postgresql-network.png "AWS PostgreSQL Network")

### ElastiCache for Redis (Cache) Pre-work

You will create a new [ElastiCache for Redis](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticache/redis) instance to host the Scan Farm cache. First you must create a custom parameter group to apply required settings to your cluster.

![AWS Redis Parameter Group](images/aws-redis-parameter-group.png "AWS Redis Parameter Group")

Specify "noeviction" for the maxmemory-policy parameter. The Cache Service will fail to start with the default value for maxmemory-policy.

![AWS Redis Parameter Value](images/aws-redis-parameter-value.png "AWS Redis Parameter Value")

Create a new Redis cluster using an option where you can specify your parameter group and choose your instance size.

![AWS Redis](images/aws-redis.png "AWS Redis")

The memory limit should be 1 GB, however, this should be adjusted based on your requirements. The Cache Service checks the memory usage of the Redis server at start-up and will not start if memory usage is more than 99% of the server limit.

![AWS Redis Details](images/aws-redis-details.png "AWS Redis Details")

Your cache instance must permit network traffic from the Cache Service pod.

![AWS Redis Network](images/aws-redis-network.png "AWS Redis Network")

Consider enabling authentication and TLS for your cache instance. If you enable TLS, you must download the certificate file for your Redis instance. Running openssl with the s_client parameter from a system with cache connectivity is one way to obtain your Redis certificate file.

![AWS Redis Auth](images/aws-redis-auth.png "AWS Redis Auth")

### Simple Storage Service (Object Storage) Pre-work

Create two new [Simple Storage Service](https://aws.amazon.com/s3) buckets, one for the Storage Service and one for the Cache Service.

![AWS Storage Storage Bucket](images/aws-object-storage-storage.png "AWS Storage Storage Bucket")

After creating the cache bucket, open the bucket details page.

![AWS Storage Cache Bucket](images/aws-object-storage-cache.png "AWS Storage Cache Bucket")

You must define a cache bucket lifecycle policy with an object expiration greater than (not equal to) 7 days. The Cache Service checks that this lifecycle rule is present and will not start if a lifecycle policy retention period is not set. The bucket details screen allows you to create a new lifecycle policy rule. Define a new "Delete object" rule that expires current versions of objects after 8 days or more.

![AWS Storage Cache Bucket Add Rule](images/aws-object-storage-cache-lifecycle.png "AWS Storage Cache Bucket Add Rule")

Ensure that the Cache Service and Storage Service have network connectivity to their buckets.

Software Risk Manager requires read/write bucket access, and access to the cache bucket's lifecycle policy is required (s3:GetLifecycleConfiguration permission). You can use an AWS account's access and secret key or you can configure [AWS IAM Roles for Service Account](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/iam-roles-for-service-accounts.html) to link an IAM role to a Kubernetes service account that the Cache Service and Storage Service will use for bucket access.

## GCP Scan Farm Pre-work

You can satisfy Scan Farm feature dependencies with GCP services.

### GKE Scanner Nodes Pre-work

Create a new [GKS node pool](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/node-pools) for your Scan Farm nodes. Select an instance type that includes 8 vCPUs and 32 GiB of RAM. 

![GKE Node Pool](images/gcp-node-pool.png "GKE Node Pool")

Visit the "Metadata" page before clicking "Create" to generate your node pool. In the "Kubernetes labels" section (not the "Labels" section), click "ADD KUBERNETES LABEL" and specify Key=pool-type and Value=small.

![GKE Node Pool Label](images/gcp-node-pool-label.png "GKE Node Pool Label")

 In the "Node taints" section, click "ADD TAINT" and specify Key=NodeType, Value=ScannerNode, and Effect=NoSchedule.

![GKE Node Pool Taint](images/gcp-node-pool-taint.png "GKE Node Pool Taint")

### Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL (Database) Pre-work

Create a new [PostgreSQL database](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/postgres) instance to host the Scan Farm's database catalogs for the Scan Service and Storage Service.

![GCP PostgreSQL](images/gcp-postgresql.png "GCP PostgreSQL")

Allocate storage capacity and specify an instance size that meets the CPU and memory requirements in the Scan Farm Database Requirements section.

![GCP PostgreSQL Instance](images/gcp-postgresql-instance.png "GCP PostgreSQL Instance")

Your PostgreSQL database instance must permit network traffic from the Storage Service and Scan Service pods.

![GCP PostgreSQL Network](images/gcp-postgresql-network.png "GCP PostgreSQL Network")

### Memorystore for Redis (Cache) Pre-work

Create a new [Memorystore for Redis](https://cloud.google.com/memorystore) instance to host the Scan Farm cache.

![GCP Redis](images/gcp-redis.png "GCP Redis")

The memory limit should be 1 GB, however, this should be adjusted based on your requirements. The Cache Service checks the memory usage of the Redis server at start-up and will not start if memory usage is more than 99% of the server limit.

![GCP Redis Capacity](images/gcp-redis-capacity.png "GCP Redis Capacity")

Your cache instance must permit network traffic from the Cache Service pod.

![GCP Redis Network](images/gcp-redis-network.png "GCP Redis Network")

Your instance must include a maxmemory-policy that is set to noeviction. The Cache Service design requires that all metadata be resident in Redis at all times. The Cache Service will refuse to start if Redis is not correctly configured.

![GCP Redis MemPolicy](images/gcp-redis-mempolicy.png "GCP Redis MemPolicy")

Consider enabling authentication and TLS for your cache instance.

![GCP Redis Auth](images/gcp-redis-auth.png "GCP Redis Auth")

If you enable TLS, open your instance configuration details and download the instance's CA certificate from the TLS Certificate Authority section of the Security page.

![GCP Redis Cert Download](images/gcp-redis-cert-download.png "GCP Redis Cert Download")

### Cloud Storage (Object Storage) Pre-work

Create two new [Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage) buckets, one for the Storage Service and one for the Cache Service.

![GCP Storage Storage Bucket](images/gcp-object-storage-storage.png "GCP Storage Storage Bucket")

After creating the cache bucket, open the bucket details page.

![GCP Storage Cache Bucket](images/gcp-object-storage-cache.png "GCP Storage Cache Bucket")

You must define a cache bucket lifecycle policy with an object expiration greater than (not equal to) 7 days. The Cache Service checks that this lifecycle rule is present and will not start if a lifecycle policy retention period is not set. The bucket details screen allows you to create a new lifecycle policy rule. Define a new "Delete object" rule that uses an "Age" condition to remove objects older than 8+ days. 

![GCP Storage Cache Bucket Add Rule](images/gcp-object-storage-cache-lifecycle-add-rule.png "GCP Storage Cache Bucket Add Rule")

Ensure that the Cache Service and Storage Service have network connectivity to their buckets. Software Risk Manager requires read/write bucket access, and access to the cache bucket's lifecycle policy is required. Grant bucket permission to a GCP service account that the Software Risk Manager will use for bucket access.

![GCP Storage Permissions](images/gcp-object-storage-permissions.png "GCP Storage Permissions")

Create a new JSON key for the GCP service account with bucket access.

![GCP Storage Key](images/gcp-object-storage-key.png "GCP Storage Key")

## Azure Scan Farm Pre-work

You can satisfy Scan Farm feature dependencies with Azure services. 

### AKS Scanner Nodes Pre-work

Create a new [AKS node pool](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/create-node-pools) for your Scan Farm nodes. Select an instance type that includes 8 vCPUs and 32 GiB of RAM. 

![Azure Node Pool](images/azure-node-pool.png "Azure Node Pool")

Visit the "Optional settings" page before clicking "Review + Create" to generate your node pool. In the "Labels" section, specify Key=pool-type and Value=small.

![Azure Node Pool Label](images/azure-node-pool-label.png "Azure Node Pool Label")

In the "Taints" section, specify Key=NodeType, Value=ScannerNode, and Effect=NoSchedule.

![Azure Node Pool Taint](images/azure-node-pool-taint.png "Azure Node Pool Taint")

### Azure Database for PostgreSQL (Database) Pre-work

Create a new [PostgreSQL database](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/postgresql) instance to host the Scan Farm's database catalogs for the Scan Service and Storage Service.

![Azure PostgreSQL](images/azure-postgresql.png "Azure PostgreSQL")

Allocate storage capacity and specify an instance size that meets the CPU and memory requirements in the Scan Farm Database Requirements section.

![Azure PostgreSQL Instance](images/azure-postgresql-instance.png "Azure PostgreSQL Instance")

Your PostgreSQL database instance must permit network traffic from the Storage Service and Scan Service pods.

![Azure PostgreSQL Network](images/azure-postgresql-network.png "Azure PostgreSQL Network")

### Azure Cache for Redis (Cache) Pre-work

You will create a new [Azure Cache for Redis](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/cache/) instance to host the Scan Farm cache. The memory limit should be 1 GB, however, this should be adjusted based on your requirements. The Cache Service checks the memory usage of the Redis server at start-up and will not start if memory usage is more than 99% of the server limit.

![Azure Redis](images/azure-redis.png "Azure Redis")

Your cache instance must permit network traffic from the Cache Service pod.

Your instance must include a maxmemory-policy that is set to noeviction. The Cache Service design requires that all metadata be resident in Redis at all times. The Cache Service will refuse to start if Redis is not correctly configured.

![Azure Redis MemPolicy](images/azure-redis-mempolicy.png "Azure Redis MemPolicy")

Your instance must include a maxmemory-policy that is set to noeviction. The Cache Service design requires that all metadata be resident in Redis at all times. The Cache Service will refuse to start if Redis is not correctly configured.

You can obtain your Redis key by clicking the "Access keys" link for your Azure Cache for Redis instance.

![Azure Redis Auth](images/azure-redis-auth.png "Azure Redis Auth")

Your Azure Cache for Redis will use a certificate issued by DigiCert Global G2 CA Root ([as of May 2022](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-cache-for-redis/cache-whats-new#tls-certificate-change)). You can find Azure certificates [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/fundamentals/azure-ca-details).

### Azure Cloud Storage (Object Storage) Pre-work

>Note: Scan Farm support for Azure object storage will be available with SRM 2023.12.0.

Create a new [Azure Storage Account](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-account-create) to host two containers, one for the Storage Service and one for the Cache Service.

![Azure Storage Account](images/azure-create-storage.png "Azure Storage Account")

The storage account name you specify will become part of the URL used to access your storage containers.

![Azure Storage Account](images/azure-storage-account-name.png "Azure Storage Account")

Create a [blob container](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/blob-containers-portal) in your storage account for the Storage Service.

![Azure Storage Container](images/azure-object-storage-storage.png "Azure Storage Container")

Create a second [blob container](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/blob-containers-portal) in your storage account for the Cache Service.

![Azure Cache Container](images/azure-object-storage-cache.png "Azure Cache Container")

You must define a storage account lifecycle policy that deletes cache container blobs greater than (not equal to) 7 days old. The Cache Service checks that this lifecycle rule is present and will not start if a lifecycle policy retention period is not set. Create a new [Lifecycle management policy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/lifecycle-management-policy-configure) for your storage account. The lifecycle management rule must specify a rule scope that uses a filter set to limit scope to the cache blob.

![Azure Lifecycle Rule Details](images/azure-object-storage-cache-lifecycle-add-rule-details.png "Azure Lifecycle Rule Details")

Set the if-then rule to delete blobs whose last modified date is 8 days or older. Define the policy using Last modified (the Cache Service validation will not accept a policy based on Created).

![Azure Lifecycle Rule Base](images/azure-object-storage-cache-lifecycle-add-rule-base.png "Azure Lifecycle Rule Base")

The lifecycle rule should not apply to the Storage Service blob container, so enter your Cache Storage blob container name as the Blob prefix of your filter set.

![Azure Lifecycle Rule Filter](images/azure-object-storage-cache-lifecycle-add-rule-filter-set.png "Azure Lifecycle Rule Filter")

To configure Azure object storage, you will need the following information:

- Subscription ID
- Tenant ID
- Storage Account Azure Resource Group
- Storage Account Name
- Storage Account Access Key
- Storage Account Endpoint
- Azure Microsoft Entra ID Application (client) ID
- Azure Microsoft Entra ID Client Secret

>Note: Microsoft Entra ID is the new name for Azure Active Directory.

You can find your subscription ("id" field) and tenant identifiers ("tenantId" field) using the following command.

```
az account show
```

You can obtain your Storage Account Access Key by clicking the "Access keys" link for your storage account.

![Azure Storage Account Key](images/azure-object-storage-access-keys.png "Azure Storage Account Key")

You can obtain your Storage Account Endpoint by clicking the "Endpoints" link for your storage account. The "Blob service" field contains your endpoint.

![Azure Storage Endpoints](images/azure-object-storage-endpoints.png "Azure Storage Endpoints")

The Scan Farm depends on a [Microsoft Entra ID app registration](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/app-objects-and-service-principals) with read/write access to your Azure storage containers. You must register a new application with Microsoft Entra ID.

![Azure App Registration](images/azure-object-storage-app-register.png "Azure App Registration")

You can obtain your App Registration "application (client) ID" by clicking the "Overview" link for your registration.

![Azure App Registration Client ID](images/azure-object-storage-app-register-client-id.png "Azure App Registration Client ID")

You can obtain your App Registration client secret value by clicking the "Certificates & secrets" link for your registration.

![Azure App Registration Client Secret](images/azure-object-storage-app-register-client-secret.png "Azure App Registration Client Secret")

You must grant your app registration read/write access to your storage account containers along with access to read the delete blob policy you created. You can add a new role assignment by clicking the "Access Control (IAM)" link for your storage account.

![Azure App Registration Access](images/azure-object-storage-app-register-access.png "Azure App Registration Access")

Your storage account role assignment should reference your app registration. As an example, you can grant read/write blob container policy with the Azure Storage Blob Data Contributor role and policy access with the Storage Account Contributor role.

![Azure App Registration Role](images/azure-object-storage-app-role-assignment.png "Azure App Registration Role")

Ensure that the Cache Service and Storage Service have network connectivity to their blob containers.

## On-Cluster Scan Farm Pre-work

You can satisfy Scan Farm feature dependencies with components you install on your cluster. Note the license type for the components listed below. You are responsible for compliance with the licenses of third-party components.

### Scanner Nodes Pre-work

Scan Farm SAST or SCA analyses require a dedicated node pool with a specific node label and taint. You can run more than one SCA scan on a single node, but a single SAST analysis requires exclusive node access during the scan. You can assign a node label and taint using the following command where "scan-farm-worker-node-name" represents the name of a cluster node.

```
kubectl label --overwrite node scan-farm-worker-node-name pool-type=small
kubectl taint node scan-farm-worker-node-name NodeType=ScannerNode:NoSchedule
```

If using a cloud-hosted node pool, specify the node label and taint with your node pool configuration so that generated nodes meet Scan Farm requirements.

### Bitnami PostgreSQL Chart Pre-work

The PostgreSQL license is available [here](https://www.postgresql.org/about/licence/). The Bitnami PostgreSQL Helm chart license is available [here](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/main/bitnami/postgresql#license).

Allocate storage capacity and specify an instance size that meets the CPU and memory requirements in the Scan Farm Database Requirements section. The following is an example of the PostgreSQL chart parameters for version 11.6.2 that customizes PostgreSQL to meet Scan Farm requirements:

```
primary:
  persistence:
    size: 5Gi
  resources:
    limits:
      memory: 2Gi
      cpu: 1000m
```

If you store the above YAML in a file named postgresql.yaml, you can run helm like this:

```
helm -n srm upgrade --create-namespace --install --repo https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami --version 12.12.10 postgresql postgresql -f postgresql.yaml
```

>Note: The chart notes explain how to obtain the initial password.

### Bitnami Redis Chart Pre-work

The Redis license is available [here](https://redis.io/docs/about/license/). The Bitnami Redis Helm chart license is available [here](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/main/bitnami/redis#license).

Set the Redis architecture to standalone using the redis.architecture Helm chart parameter. You can enable authentication using the redis.auth.enabled chart parameter after setting the auth.existingSecret and auth.existingSecretPasswordKey parameters by referencing a Kubernetes Secret resource with the authentication password. The following is an example of the Redis chart parameters for version 17.3.17 that customizes Redis to meet Scan Farm requirements:

```
architecture: standalone
auth:
  enabled: true
commonConfiguration: |-
  save ""
  appendonly no
  maxmemory 1gb
  maxmemory-policy noeviction
master:
  persistence:
    enabled: false
  resources:
    limits:
      cpu: 1
      memory: 1100Mi
```

If you store the above YAML in a file named redis.yaml, you can run helm like this:

```
helm -n srm upgrade --create-namespace --install --repo https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami --version 17.3.17 redis redis -f redis.yaml
```

>Note: The chart notes explain how to obtain the initial password.

Set the redis.tls Helm chart configuration based on whether you plan to enable TLS for your Redis instance. You can find the Redis TLS certificate in its pod at /opt/bitnami/redis/certs/tls.crt.

### Bitnami MinIO Chart Pre-work

The MinIO software is licensed under the [GNU Affero General Public License v3.0](https://github.com/minio/minio/blob/master/LICENSE) or a commercial enterprise license. The Bitnami MinIO Helm chart license is available [here](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/main/bitnami/minio#license).

The following is an example of the MinIO chart parameters for version 11.10.24 that customizes Redis to meet Scan Farm requirements (refer to the requirements section to identify the storage size suitable for your environment):

```
provisioning:
  enabled: true
  buckets:
  - name:  "storage"
    region: us-east-1
  - name: "cache"
    region: us-east-1
    lifecycle:
    - id: cache
      disabled: false
      expiry:
        days: 8
persistence:
  size: 100Gi
```

If you store the above YAML in a file named minio.yaml, you can run helm like this:

```
helm -n srm upgrade --create-namespace --install --repo https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami --version 11.10.24 minio minio -f minio.yaml
```

>Note: The chart notes explain how to obtain the initial password.

Set MinIO's root username and password using the minio.auth.rootUser and minio.auth.rootPassword Helm chart parameters. You can define default buckets for the Storage Service and Cache Service using the minio.defaultBuckets chart parameter, or you can create them by hand after installing MinIO.  

You must configure a lifecycle policy on the cache bucket. If you did not configure the policy during deployment, you can use the following command with an "srm" mc alias you can define using the MinIO endpoint and root credential, replacing the cache-bucket name and day count (must be greater than, not equal to, 7) as necessary:

```
$ mc alias set srm <MinIO endpoint> <MinIO root username> <MinIO root password>
$ mc ilm add --expiry-days 8 srm/cache-bucket
```

If your Scan Farm storage runs on the same cluster where you plan to install Software Risk Manager, the Software Risk Manager web component can access your storage using the in-cluster storage URL. This optional optimization works only when both components run on the same cluster.

You can make MinIO available at a URL different from your Software Risk Manager URL. For example, if your Software Risk Manager hostname is srm.local, you can make MinIO available at a different URL like https://minio.local:9000/.

Alternatively, you can proxy MinIO by using the same hostname for both Software Risk Manager and MinIO. For example, if your Software Risk Manager hostname is srm.local, you can make MinIO available at https://srm.local/upload/.

The following example uses hostname `srm.local` to make the `minio` Kubernetes service available at http://srm.local/upload/. Note the use of the `use-regex` and `rewrite-target` annotations to drop "/upload/" when routing a request to the MinIO service.

```
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-body-size: 500m
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /$1
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/use-regex: "true"
  name: minio
  namespace: srm
spec:
  ingressClassName: nginx
  rules:
  - host: srm.local
    http:
      paths:
      - backend:
          service:
            name: minio
            port:
              number: 9000
        path: /upload/(.*)
        pathType: ImplementationSpecific
```

Note your external MinIO URL and your in-cluster URL if you plan to specify that optimization in the Helm Prep Wizard.

# Tool Orchestration Pre-work

You can skip this section if you do not plan to use the Tool Orchestration feature or if you plan to use the feature without external workflow storage. Complete the following pre-work before installing the Tool Orchestration feature with external workflow storage.

## Node Pool Pre-work

Tool Orchestration does not require a dedicated node pool, but you can establish one using Kubernetes labels and node taints. You can skip this section if you plan to run Tool Orchestration workloads alongside other Software Risk Manager workloads. The Software Risk Manager Helm chart includes a PodDisruptionBudget to help ensure that tool runs do not block higher-priority workloads.

## Object Storage Pre-work

When you opt for external workflow storage for Tool Orchestration workloads, you will not use the older MinIO version referenced by the Software Risk Manager Helm chart. You are responsible for configuring external object storage that supports the AWS S3 API and for creating a single bucket that you will use to store all Tool Orchestration workflow data.

### AWS

[Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) is supported for tool orchestration workflow storage when your bucket is accessible using an access and secret key. The bucket must be accessible from the cluster running orchestrated analyses.

You can opt for this storage type by selecting `External (Access Key)` from the Orchestrated Analysis Storage screen of the Helm Prep Wizard.

>Note: Using [AWS IRSA](#aws-irsa) is preferred to using `External (Access Key)`.

The following AWS permissions are required for the AWS sevice account:

- s3:GetObject
- s3:DeleteObject
- s3:PutObject
- s3:ListBucket

You can follow the below example, which includes bash commands that shows one way to configure bucket access.

1. Define variables used for this example

```
account_id=$(aws sts get-caller-identity --query "Account" --output text)
username='username'
bucket='srm-bucket'
```

2. Create a policy

```
cat > srm-tool-orchestration-policy.json << EOF
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "VisualEditor0",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:DeleteObject",
                "s3:PutObject",
                "s3:ListBucket"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::$bucket",
                "arn:aws:s3:::$bucket/*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
EOF

aws iam create-policy --policy-name srm-tool-orchestration-policy --policy-document file://srm-tool-orchestration-policy.json
```

3. Attach policy to account

```
aws iam attach-user-policy --user-name=$username --policy-arn=arn:aws:iam::$account_id:policy/srm-tool-orchestration-policy
```

If you want to uninstall what you created above, run the following commands:

```
account_id=$(aws sts get-caller-identity --query "Account" --output text)
username='username'

policy_arn="arn:aws:iam::$account_id:policy/srm-tool-orchestration-policy"

aws iam detach-user-policy --user-name=$username --policy-arn=$policy_arn
aws iam delete-policy      --policy-arn $policy_arn
```

### AWS IRSA

[AWS IAM Roles for Service Account (IRSA)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/iam-roles-for-service-accounts.html) is supported for tool orchestration workflow storage when your bucket is accessible from the AWS cluster running orchestrated analyses.

You can opt for this storage type by selecting `External (AWS IAM)` from the Orchestrated Analysis Storage screen of the Helm Prep Wizard.

You must provision Kubernetes ServiceAccount resources for both the SRM Tool Service and tool workflows and link them to the IAM permissions below. The Helm Prep Wizard will prompt for the account names.

The following AWS permissions are required for the tool service:

- s3:GetObject
- s3:DeleteObject
- s3:PutObject
- s3:ListBucket

The following AWS permissions are required for the workflow service:

- s3:GetObject
- s3:PutObject
- s3:ListBucket

After you have an [IAM OIDC provider for your cluster](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/enable-iam-roles-for-service-accounts.html), you can follow the below example, which includes bash commands that show one way to configure AWS IRSA for two service accounts named `toolsvc-sa` and `workflow-sa`.

1. Define variables used for this example

```
account_id=$(aws sts get-caller-identity --query "Account" --output text)
awsRegion='us-east-2'

clusterName='srm'
oidc_provider=$(aws eks describe-cluster --name $clusterName --region $awsRegion --query "cluster.identity.oidc.issuer" --output text | sed -e "s/^https:\/\///")

namespace='srm'
tool_svc_service_account='toolsvc-sa'
workflow_service_account='workflow-sa'

bucket='srm-bucket'
```

2. Create Tool Service policy

```
cat > tool-service-policy.json << EOF
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "VisualEditor0",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:DeleteObject",
                "s3:PutObject",
                "s3:ListBucket"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::$bucket",
                "arn:aws:s3:::$bucket/*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
EOF

aws iam create-policy --policy-name srm-tool-service-bucket-policy --policy-document file://tool-service-policy.json
```

3. Create Workflow policy

```
cat > workflow-policy.json << EOF
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "VisualEditor0",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:PutObject",
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:ListBucket"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::$bucket",
                "arn:aws:s3:::$bucket/*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
EOF

aws iam create-policy --policy-name srm-workflow-bucket-policy --policy-document file://workflow-policy.json
```

4. Create Tool Service role

```
cat > tool-service-role.json << EOF
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "Federated": "arn:aws:iam::$account_id:oidc-provider/$oidc_provider"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity",
      "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
          "$oidc_provider:aud": "sts.amazonaws.com",
          "$oidc_provider:sub": "system:serviceaccount:$namespace:$tool_svc_service_account"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
EOF

aws iam create-role --role-name srm-tool-service-bucket-role --assume-role-policy-document file://tool-service-role.json --description "srm-tool-service-bucket-role"
```

5. Create Workflow role

```
cat > workflow-role.json << EOF

kubectl annotate serviceaccount -n $namespace $workflow_service_account eks.amazonaws.com/role-arn-

kubectl -n $namespace delete serviceaccount $tool_svc_service_account $workflow_service_account
```

### GCP

[Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/introduction) is supported for tool orchestration workflow storage when your bucket is accessible using an [HMAC key](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/authentication/hmackeys) with an Access ID and Secret. The bucket must be accessible from the cluster running orchestrated analyses.

You can opt for this storage type by selecting `External (Access Key)` from the Orchestrated Analysis Storage screen of the Helm Prep Wizard.

### MinIO

[MinIO](https://min.io/) is supported for tool orchestration workflow storage when your bucket is accessible using an access and secret key. The bucket must be accessible from the cluster running orchestrated analyses.

You can opt for this storage type by selecting `External (Access Key)` from the Orchestrated Analysis Storage screen of the Helm Prep Wizard.

# Password Pre-work

How many passwords you must set will depend on how you deploy Software Risk Manager. The Helm chart will auto-generate unspecified passwords where support is available.

| Password/Key | Feature | Auto-generate Support |
|:-|:-:|:-:|
| Software Risk Manager Web Admin Password | Core | Y |
| Web Database User Password | Core | Y |
| | | |
| Web Database Root Password | Core (On-Cluster DB) | Y |
| Web Database Replication Password | Core (On-Cluster DB) | Y |
| | | |
| Private Docker Registry Password | Core (Private Registry) | Y |
| | | |
| SAML Java Keystore Password | Core (SAML Authentication) | Y |
| SAML Java Private Key Password | Core (SAML Authentication) | Y |

| Tool Orchestration Tool Service Key | Tool Orchestration | Y |
| Tool Orchestration MinIO Admin Password | Tool Orchestration | Y |
| Tool Orchestration External Workflow Storage Password | Tool Orchestration | Y |

# Network Policies

The Software Risk Manager deployment supports network policies for non-Scan Farm components.

# TLS Pre-work

The Software Risk Manager deployment includes optional support for TLS connections between non-Scan Farm components using Istio or Kubernetes Certificate Signing Requests (CSR).

## Istio

You can configure an [Istio Service Mesh](https://istio.io/latest/) that provides TLS support. The Core and Tool Orchestration features have been tested with Istio; however, the Tool Orchestration feature's Istio compatibility requires using [Istio's Ambient mode](https://istio.io/latest/blog/2022/introducing-ambient-mesh/).

>Note: Using the Software Risk Manager network policies with Istio enabled is currently unsupported.

You may need to install the Kubernetes Gateway API CRDs: kubectl kustomize "github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/config/crd/experimental?ref=v1.1.0" | kubectl apply -f -;

You can deploy Istio in Ambient mode using the [Helm installation instructions](https://istio.io/latest/docs/ambient/install/helm-installation/).

You can add Software Risk Manager components to the mesh using the namespace label `istio.io/dataplane-mode=ambient`. For example, you can run the following command to label the `srm` namespace:

```
kubectl label namespace srm istio.io/dataplane-mode=ambient
```

You can enable mTLS between Software Risk Manager components running in the Software Risk Manager namespace by creating a PeerAuthentication policy resource. For example, you can generate a resource from the following YAML for the `srm` namespace:

```
apiVersion: security.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: PeerAuthentication
metadata:
  name: default
  namespace: srm
spec:
  mtls:
    mode: STRICT
```

You can install [Prometheus](https://istio.io/latest/docs/ops/integrations/prometheus/) and [Kiali](https://istio.io/latest/docs/ops/integrations/kiali/) to [Visualize Your Mesh](https://istio.io/latest/docs/tasks/observability/kiali/#generating-a-graph). You can then enable the Security badge Display option to see the location of mTLS connections.

## Cert-Manager

You can use the cert-manager support for Kubernetes CSRs, which is in an experimental state, to issue certificates for Software Risk Manager Core and Tool Orchestration components. Follow the cert-manager kube-csr [installation instructions](https://cert-manager.io/docs/usage/kube-csr/) and then define either an Issuer or ClusterIssuer [resource](https://cert-manager.io/docs/configuration/).

If you plan to enable TLS connections with Cert-Manager, you must have access to your CA public key and know your CSR signer name before you run the Helm Prep Wizard (see [Full Installation](#installation---full)).

Refer to the comments at either the top of [values-tls.yaml](../chart/values/values-tls.yaml) or the [Helm TLS Values (values-tls.yaml) appendix](#helm-tls-values-values-tlsyaml) for how to create related certificate resources.

### Cert-Manager Self-signed CA Example

This cert-manager 1.14.2 example shows one way to use cert-manager to issue certificates for the Core and Tool Orchestration features. It creates a cluster-scoped ClusterIssuer using a self-signed CA.

1. Install cert-manager v1.14.2:

```
$ kubectl apply -f https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.14.2/cert-manager.crds.yaml
$ helm repo add jetstack https://charts.jetstack.io --force-update
$ helm repo update
$ helm install cert-manager jetstack/cert-manager --namespace cert-manager --create-namespace --version v1.14.2 --set featureGates="ExperimentalCertificateSigningRequestControllers=true"
```

2. Create a signing key and certificate with the common name Private CA:

```
$ openssl genrsa -out ca.key 2048
$ openssl req -x509 -new -key ca.key -subj "/CN=Private CA" -days 3650 -out ca.crt
```

3. Create a Kubernetes Secret named ca-key-pair in the cert-manager namespace:

```
$ kubectl -n cert-manager create secret tls ca-key-pair --cert=ca.crt --key=ca.key
```

4. Create a new file named clusterissuer.yaml with the following contents:

```
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: ClusterIssuer
metadata:
  name: ca-issuer
spec:
  ca:
    secretName: ca-key-pair
```

5. Run the following command to create the ca-issuer ClusterIssuer:

```
kubectl apply -f ./clusterissuer.yaml
```

6. Wait for the following command to show a Ready status:

```
kubectl get clusterissuer ca-issuer -o wide
```

When you run the Helm Prep Wizard (see [Full Installation](#installation---full)) and enable TLS on the Configure TLS screen, specify `clusterissuers.cert-manager.io/ca-issuer` for your CSR signer name and enter the path to your ca.crt for your Kubernetes CA cert.

>Note: The wizard will include an installation note referencing additional pre-work documented in the values-tls.yaml file.

# Licensing

You will receive a license zip file with four files if you purchased Software Risk Manager with the Scan Farm feature, including SAST and SCA.

| File | Purpose |
|:-|:-|
| 00000000-SRM-CDX.txt | Software Risk Manager Web license |
| 00000000-SRM-SAVE.dat | Software Risk Manager Scan Farm SAST license |
| 00000000-SRM-SCA.json | Software Risk Manager Scan Farm SCA license |
| 00000000-SRM-CodeSight.json | Software Risk Manager Code Sight license |

The Quick Start installation method described in the next section does not accept a license file, so you will enter your 00000000-SRM-CDX.txt file in the Software Risk Manager UI when prompted. The full installation process will prompt for a Web license file and the SAST and SCA licenses if you plan to use those Scan Farm features.

# Installation - Quick Start

You can follow the Quick Start instructions if you want to deploy Software Risk Manager using default settings and either the Core or Tool Orchestration features. If you want to customize your deployment or use the Scan Farm feature, you cannot use the Quick Start deployment method.

The Software Risk Manager Helm chart creates multiple Kubernetes Secret resources. Refer to [Good practices for Kubernetes Secrets](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/secrets-good-practices/) for configuration recommendations and for how to [configure encryption at rest](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/secrets-good-practices/#configure-encryption-at-rest).

## Core Quick Start

Run the following commands to install Software Risk Manager Core using the default configuration:

```
$ helm -n srm upgrade --reset-values --install --create-namespace --repo https://synopsys-sig.github.io/srm-k8s srm srm # --set openshift.createSCC=true
```

>Note: If you are using OpenShift, remove `#` when running the last command.

## Tool Orchestration Quick Start

Run the following commands to install Software Risk Manager with Tool Orchestration using the default configuration:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/synopsys-sig/srm-k8s
$ kubectl apply -f srm-k8s/crds/v1
$ helm -n srm upgrade --reset-values --install --create-namespace --repo https://synopsys-sig.github.io/srm-k8s -f srm-k8s/chart/values/values-to.yaml srm srm # --set openshift.createSCC=true
```

>Note 1: If you are installing in a namespace other than srm, you must specify that namespace by replacing "srm" in the following helm --set command: `argo-workflows.controller.workflowNamespaces={srm}`.

>Note 2: If you are using OpenShift, remove `#` when running the last command.

## Fetch Initial Admin Password

You can retrieve the initial Software Risk Manager admin password using a command in the helm release notes, which appear when a helm install/upgrade concludes. You can view the helm release notes at any time by running this command, replacing the namespace and helm release name as necessary:

```
helm -n srm get notes srm
```

# Installation - Full

The full installation method supports all Software Risk Manager features and customizations. This GitHub repository contains tools to help simplify deploying Software Risk Manager on your cluster.

Your first Software Risk Manager Kubernetes deployment is a four-step process:

- Clone this GitHub Repository
- Run Helm Prep Wizard (once)
- Run Helm Prep Script
- Invoke helm/kubectl Commands

>Note: Software Risk Manager upgrades require three steps; you will not rerun the Help Prep Wizard when upgrading Software Risk Manager.

The Software Risk Manager Helm chart creates multiple Kubernetes Secret resources. Refer to [Good practices for Kubernetes Secrets](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/secrets-good-practices/) for configuration recommendations and for how to [configure encryption at rest](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/secrets-good-practices/#configure-encryption-at-rest).

## Prerequisites

The deployment scripts in the [srm-k8s GitHub repository](https://github.com/synopsys-sig/srm-k8s) require [PowerShell Core](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/overview), which runs on macOS, Linux, and Windows. 

>Note: PowerShell Core differs from Windows PowerShell, which is available on Windows only.

See the following sections for operating system-specific prerequisites. 

### Linux Prerequisites

Use the following links to install the prerequisite software on your Linux system.

- [PowerShell Core](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-on-linux)
- [Java JRE](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?package=jre&version=11) (specifically, keytool in your PATH)
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-linux/) (version should match your cluster's Kubernetes version)

The scripts in the repository depend on the `keytool` program, bundled with the Java JRE, and the `kubectl` program, both of which must be included in your PATH.

>Note: You do not need to be connected to your cluster to run the Helm Prep Wizard or Helm Prep Script because both use client-side kubectl capabilities. If your kubectl context is not empty, it should be a valid configuration.

### macOS Prerequisites

Use the following links to install the prerequisite software on your macOS system.

- [PowerShell Core](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-on-macos)
- [Java JRE](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?package=jre&version=11) (specifically, keytool in your PATH)
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-macos/) (version should match your cluster's Kubernetes version)

The scripts in the repository depend on the `keytool` program, bundled with the Java JRE, and the `kubectl` program, both of which must be included in your PATH.

>Note: You do not need to be connected to your cluster to run the Helm Prep Wizard or Helm Prep Script because both use client-side kubectl capabilities. If your kubectl context is not empty, it should be a valid configuration.

### Windows Prerequisites

Use the following links to install the prerequisite software on your Windows system.

- [PowerShell Core](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-on-windows) (not [Windows PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/whats-new/differences-from-windows-powershell))
- [Java JRE](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?package=jre&version=11) (specifically, keytool in your PATH)
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-windows/) (version should match your cluster's Kubernetes version)

The scripts in the repository depend on the `keytool` program, bundled with the Java JRE, and the `kubectl` program, both of which must be included in your PATH.

>Note: You do not need to be connected to your cluster to run the Helm Prep Wizard or Helm Prep Script because both use client-side kubectl capabilities. If your kubectl context is not empty, it should be a valid configuration.

Ensure you can run PowerShell Core scripts on Windows by switching your PowerShell Execution Policy to RemoteSigned (recommended) or Unrestricted. To do so, you must run the Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned command from an elevated/administrator Command Prompt:

```
1. Locate Command Prompt in your Start menu
2. Click "Run as administrator"
3. C:\> pwsh
4. PS C:\> Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
```

### PowerShell Module

The Helm Prep Wizard has a dependency on a Synopsys PowerShell module published to the [PowerShell Gallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/guided-setup) and [NuGet Repository](https://www.nuget.org/packages/guided-setup). The wizard will automatically download and install the module when it starts. If you would prefer to download and install the module by hand, refer to the [manual installation note](../.install-guided-setup-module.ps1#L12) in the module installation script.

## Clone GitHub Repository

The [srm-k8s GitHub repository](https://github.com/synopsys-sig/srm-k8s) repository contains what you need to start your Software Risk Manager Kubernetes deployment. Clone the repository to a stable directory on your system. You will use your cloned repository for both your initial deployment and for deploying future Software Risk Manager software upgrades.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/synopsys-sig/srm-k8s
```

## Helm Prep Wizard

You can think of the Helm Prep Wizard as an interactive installation document that gets you ready to deploy Software Risk Manager using Helm. It is a [PowerShell Core 7](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell?view=powershell-7) script you can run on macOS, Linux, or Windows to select Software Risk Manager deployment features and gather required deployment parameters. The Helm Prep Wizard depends on the "guided-setup" PowerShell module, which gets downloaded automatically from the PowerShell Gallery. Alternatively, you can download the module from NuGet. If you prefer to download/install manually, refer to the instructions in the installation script.

The Helm Prep Wizard displays a series of questions to help you select Software Risk Manager features and specify related deployment parameters. If you need to return to a previous screen to correct an error or revisit a question, enter 'B' to choose the "Back to Previous Step" option. If you are responding to a prompt that is not multiple choice, press Enter to reveal the "Back to Previous Step" choice.

You typically run the Helm Prep Wizard once at the outset of your initial deployment. Start the wizard after [cloning](#clone-github-repository) this GitHub repository by running the helm-prep-wizard.ps1 script from the srm-k8s directory.

```
$ cd /path/to/srm-k8s
$ pwsh ./helm-prep-wizard.ps1
```

![Helm Prep Wizard](images/helm-prep-wizard.png "Helm Prep Wizard")

## Helm Prep Script

The Helm Prep Wizard concludes by creating a run-helm-prep.ps1 script that calls the Software Risk Manager Helm Prep Script with your deployment parameters to generate Helm command and values files with dependent Kubernetes YAML resource files suitable for your Software Risk Manager deployment.

Your deployment parameters end up in a file named config.json stored in the working directory you specified in the wizard.

### Configuration File Protection

The wizard prompts for a password when necessary to encrypt specific config.json files such as passwords and keys.

If you ever want to edit protected fields in config.json, first run the unlock-config.ps1 script to replace specific config.json encrypted field values with unencrypted values, leaving your config.json file unlocked.

```
$ pwsh /path/to/git/admin/config/unlock-config.ps1 -configPath /path/to/config.json
Enter config file password:
```

Run the lock-config.ps1 script to re-encrypt config.json field values, locking your config.json file.

```
$ pwsh /path/to/git/admin/config/lock-config.ps1 -configPath /path/to/config.json
Enter config file password:
```

### Invoking the Helm Prep Script

The Software Risk Manager Helm Prep Script outputs the kubectl/helm commands and installation notes to invoke your initial deployment. The contents of the run-helm-prep.ps1 script reference the Helm Prep Script and your config.json file.

The Helm Prep Script will prompt for the password you entered because it must unlock config.json before processing its contents. You can skip the prompt by either using script's -configFilePwd parameter or by setting the HELM_PREP_CONFIGFILEPWD environment variable.

```
$ cd /path/to/srm-k8s-work-dir # selected during Helm Prep Wizard
$ pwsh ./run-helm-prep.ps1
```

## Invoke helm/kubectl Commands

Your deployment occurs when you run the commands the Helm Prep Script generates. The output of the Helm Prep Script will look similar to the following. 

```
----------------------
K8s Installation Notes
----------------------
- Your deployment includes the scan farm feature. Remember to complete the following tasks:
  * Configure external dependencies (PostgreSQL, Redis, Object Storage)
  * Define your "small" scan job node pool:
  *   Assign a pool-type label (pool-type=small) to analysis node(s).
  *   Assign a scanner node taint (NodeType=ScannerNode:NoSchedule) to analysis node(s).
  *   NOTE: A "small" pool-type requires one or more nodes with 6.5 vCPUs and 26 GB of memory
- Follow instructions at https://github.com/synopsys-sig/srm-k8s/blob/main/docs/deploy/registry.md to pull/push Synopsys Docker images to your private registry.


----------------------
Required K8s Namespace
----------------------
kubectl create namespace srm

----------------------
Required K8s Resources
----------------------
kubectl apply -f "/path/to/.k8s-srm/chart-resources"

----------------------
Required Helm Commands
----------------------
helm dependency update /path/to/git/srm-k8s/chart
helm -n srm upgrade --reset-values --install srm -f "/path/to/.k8s-srm/chart-values-combined/values-combined.yaml" --timeout 30m0s /path/to/git/srm-k8s/chart

INFO: If you use an srm-extra-props.yaml file, include '-f /path/to/srm-extra-props.yaml' as your helm command's last values file parameter.
```

- The optional `K8s Installation Notes` section will include steps you should take before creating K8s resources and running helm.
- The `Required K8s Namespace` contains the kubectl command to create your SRM namespace. If the namespace already exists, you can ignore that section.
- Running the kubectl command in the `Required K8s Resources` section will generate any K8s resources upon which your helm chart configuration depends.
- The `Required Helm Commands` section includes the helm commands you must run to deploy (or upgrade) SRM.

See the next section if you want to deploy Software Risk Manager using GitOps, specifically the Flux software. Otherwise, run the commands generated by the Helm Prep Script to deploy Software Risk Manager in your desired configuration.

>Note: If you decide to [customize your Software Risk Manager deployment](#customizing-software-risk-manager), remember to append the `-f /path/to/srm-extra-props.yaml` parameter to the helm upgrade command generated by the Helm Prep Script. If your srm-extra-props.yaml file is found alongside your config.json file, the `-f /path/to/srm-extra-props.yaml` parameter will be included automatically.

### Fetch Initial Admin Password

You can retrieve the initial Software Risk Manager admin password using a command in the helm release notes, which appear when a helm install/upgrade concludes. You can view the helm release notes at any time by running this command, replacing the namespace and helm release name as necessary:

```
helm -n srm get notes srm
```

# Deploying with GitOps (Flux)

After running the Helm Prep Wizard and Helm Prep scripts, you can optionally deploy Software Risk Manager using Flux, which is one way to implement GitOps. The Software Risk Manager deployment includes support for generating Flux-related resources. You can use an alternative GitOps solution, like [Argo CD](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), by hand-creating the related GitOps resources.

This section describes how to configure a fictitious GitHub repository named "srm-gitops" for use with [Flux](https://fluxcd.io/flux/) and [Bitnami's Sealed Secrets](https://github.com/bitnami-labs/sealed-secrets). The configuration in the git repository will manage a Kubernetes cluster referred to as the "demo" cluster where a Software Risk Manager deployment can be managed using GitOps.

Instructions that follow refer to a fictitious GitHub repository at https://github.com/synopsys-sig/srm-gitops and a made-up "srm" kubectl context. To follow along with the instructions, replace the following content:

- replace the demo directory references with a directory name that represents your cluster
- replace the srm-gitops GitHub repository references with the location of your GitHub repository
- replace the srm kubectl context references with the context name associated with your cluster

## One-Time Setup Steps

For the most up-to-date instructions, refer to the [Flux bootstrap instructions](https://fluxcd.io/flux/installation/bootstrap/). Here are the one-time Flux v2.1 steps that will bootstrap the GitHub demo cluster:

### Flux Steps:

1) Switch to the srm context:

    ```
    kubectl config use-context srm
    ```

2) Provision a GitHub PAT for a user with all GitHub 'repo' permissions. Establish a GITHUB_TOKEN environment variable:

    ```
    export GITHUB_TOKEN=<PAT>
    ```

3) Download the flux CLI tool (v2.1) and verify prerequisites:

    ```
    flux check --pre
    ```

4) Download the repo:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/synopsys-sig/srm-gitops
    ```

5) Bootstrap flux components on cluster (--token-auth bootstraps Flux for HTTPS repo access):

    ```
    cd ~/git/srm-gitops
    flux bootstrap github --token-auth --owner=sysnopsys-sig --repository=srm-gitops --branch=main --path=./demo
    ```

6) Pull latest for srm-deployment:

    ```
    cd ~/git/srm-gitops
    git pull --rebase
    ```

### Bitnami Sealed Secrets Steps:

1) Create directories for the sealed-secrets release:

    ```
    cd ~/git/srm-gitops
    mkdir -p ./demo/Releases/SealedSecrets/HelmRepository
    mkdir -p ./demo/Releases/SealedSecrets/HelmRelease
    ```

2) Generate the sealed-secrets HelmRepository resource file:

    ```
    cd ~/git/srm-gitops
    flux create source helm sealed-secrets --interval=1h --url=https://bitnami-labs.github.io/sealed-secrets --export > ./demo/Releases/SealedSecrets/HelmRepository/repo.yaml
    ```

3) Generate the sealed-secrets HelmRelease resource:

    ```
    cd ~/git/srm-gitops
    flux create helmrelease sealed-secrets --interval=1h --release-name=sealed-secrets-controller --target-namespace=flux-system --source=HelmRepository/sealed-secrets --chart=sealed-secrets --chart-version=">=1.15.0-0" --crds=CreateReplace --export > ./demo/Releases/SealedSecrets/HelmRelease/release.yaml
    ```

4) Commit files to deploy SealedSecrets:

    ```
    cd ~/git/srm-gitops
    git add ./demo/Releases/SealedSecrets
    git commit
    git push
    ```

5) Download Bitnami's [kubeseal](https://github.com/bitnami-labs/sealed-secrets/releases) and fetch public key:

    ```
    cd ~/git/srm-gitops
    kubeseal --fetch-cert --controller-name=sealed-secrets-controller --controller-namespace=flux-system > ./demo/sealed-secrets.pem
    ```

6) Commit the public key:

    ```
    cd ~/git/srm-gitops
    git add ./demo/sealed-secrets.pem
    git commit
    git push
    ```

## Software Risk Manager Deployment

With Flux and Bitnami's SealedSecrets deployed, after running the Helm Prep Wizard and Helm Prep script, run the new-flux.ps1 script in the /path/to/git/srm-k8s/admin/gitops directory, specifying the following script parameters:

```
param (
	[string]   $workDir = "$HOME/.k8s-srm",
	[Parameter(Mandatory=$true)][string] $namespace,
	[Parameter(Mandatory=$true)][string] $releaseName,
	[string]   $helmChartRepoUrl = 'https://synopsys-sig.github.io/srm-k8s',
	[string[]] $extraValuesFiles = @(),
	[switch]   $useSealedSecrets,
	[string]   $sealedSecretsNamespace = 'flux-system',
	[string]   $sealedSecretsControllerName = 'sealed-secrets-controller',
	[string]   $sealedSecretsPublicKeyPath
)
```

Use the `-extraValuesFiles` script parameter to include any extra SRM values files you use. Specify `-useSealedSecrets` to use the installed Sealed Secrets software and reference your Sealed Secrets public key file with the `-sealedSecretsPublicKeyPath` parameter. If you decide not to use Sealed Secrets, use an alternative solution to avoid storing Kubernetes secret resources in your git repository.

The new-flux.ps1 script will generate a flux-v2 directory under your work directory (`-workDir` parameter). The contents of flux-v2 will typically look like this:

```
├───ConfigMap
├───CRD
├───HelmRelease
├───HelmRepository
├───Namespace
└───SealedSecret
```

The flux-v2 directory contains the Kubernetes resources you can commit to your git repository to deploy Software Risk Manager with Flux. You can commit namespace-scoped resources to a Releases/SRM folder and cluster-scoped resources, like CRDs, under the demo folder representing your cluster:

```
├───demo
│   └───CRD
│   └───Releases
│       ├───SRM
│       │   ├───ConfigMap
│       │   ├───HelmRelease
│       │   ├───HelmRepository
│       │   ├───Namespace
│       │   └───SealedSecret
│       └───SealedSecrets
│           ├───HelmRelease
│           └───HelmRepository
```

Consider adding your *locked* config.json file and any files it references to your GitOps repository. Making your config.json file available to others will let them re-generate your work directory files and rerun new-flux.ps1 if and when that's required.

Be sure to run kubeseal by hand before adding extra Kubernetes secret resources referenced indirectly by config.json. You should drop the ".yaml" file extension from extra Helm values files to prevent Flux from trying to generate a related Kubernetes resource.

You can replace absolute paths in config.json by using paths relative to config.json's directory or `~` to reference paths relative to a home directory. For example, you can switch your work directory config.json parameter from `/Users/me/.k8s-srm` to `~/.k8s-srm`.

Below is an example showing config.json and srm-extra-props, renamed from srm-extra-props.yaml, in a HelmPrep folder under Releases/SRM. Also included is an srm-proxy-private-props.yaml SealedSecret resource created using kubeseal from the srm-proxy-private-props Kubernetes secret resource referenced by srm-extra-props.yaml:

```
├───demo
│   └───CRD
│   └───Releases
│       ├───SRM
│       │   ├───ConfigMap
│       │   ├───HelmPrep
│       │   ├───HelmPrep
│       │   |   ├─── config.json
│       │   |   ├─── srm-extra-props
│       │   |   ├─── srm-proxy-private-props.yaml
│       │   ├───HelmRelease
│       │   ├───HelmRepository
│       │   ├───Namespace
│       │   └───SealedSecret
│       └───SealedSecrets
│           ├───HelmRelease
│           └───HelmRepository
```

# Customizing Software Risk Manager

You can use a Helm values file to customize your Software Risk Manager deployment. Add custom helm property values to a file named `srm-extra-props.yaml`, and store this file alongside your config.json file when using the Helm Prep Script. You should include any custom chart settings and any web component property values you would specify in a [Software Risk Manager "props" file like codedx.props](https://sig-product-docs.synopsys.com/bundle/srm/page/install_guide/SRMConfiguration/config-files.html).

If you store your `srm-extra-props.yaml` file alongside your config.json file generated by the Helm Prep Wizard, when you run your `run-helm-prep.ps1` script, the Helm Prep Script will automatically include `-f /path/to/srm-extra-props.yaml` in the `helm upgrade` command it generates.

```
$ pwsh /path/to/run-helm-prep.ps1
  ...
  ...
  helm -n srm upgrade --reset-values --install srm ... -f /path/to/srm-extra-props.yaml
```

If you store the file elsewhere or you deployed using a Quick Start, include `-f /path/to/srm-extra-props.yaml` as the last parameter when you run `helm upgrade`:

```
helm -n srm upgrade --reset-values --install srm ... -f /path/to/srm-extra-props.yaml
```

>Note: Append `-f /path/to/srm-extra-props.yaml` to the end of your helm command to ensure your changes override other values files in the helm command.

## Specify Web Properties (codedx.props)

You can change the behavior of Software Risk Manager's web component by adding configuration properties to your `srm-extra-props.yaml` file. The Software Risk Manager Helm chart will add your properties to the Kubernetes equivalent of a `codedx.props` file.

There are two types of `codedx.props` property values you may want to configure. Private property values are those that should be protected, such as passwords, and they get stored in a Kubernetes Secret. Public property values are stored and loaded from a Kubernetes ConfigMap.

To explain the configuration of public and private properties, the following example shows how to configure a [proxy server](https://sig-product-docs.synopsys.com/bundle/srm/page/install_guide/SRMConfiguration/proxy.html) for Software Risk Manager. When you are finished configuring the public and private proxy configuration, rerun `helm upgrade` as described in the previous section.

### Public Web Properties Proxy Example

The steps in this section show you how to configure public property values by specifying values for proxy.host and proxy.port.

1. Create a file named `srm-extra-props.yaml` and add the proxy.host, proxy.port, and proxy.nonProxyHosts property values as a new section with key srm-public-props (use spaces for the indents, tab characters will cause a failure at install-time):

```
web:
  props:
    extra:
    - key:  srm-public-props
      type: values
      values:
      - "proxy.host = squid-restricted-http-proxy.squid"
      - "proxy.port = 3128"
      - "proxy.nonProxyHosts = srm-to.srm.svc.cluster.local|srm-web|localhost|*.internal.codedx.com"
```

>Note: Add non-proxy hosts as needed, separating each one with a pipe character. Software Risk Manager deployments using Tool Orchestration must include the fully qualified name of the Software Risk Manager tool service (srm-to.srm.svc.cluster.local in the above example). Software Risk Manager deployments using the Triage Assistant must include the Software Risk Manager web service name (srm-web in the above example).

2. The proxy accepts requests at port 3128. If you configured network policy, you must update your egress TCP port list using the networkPolicy property shown here:

```
web:
  props:
    extra:
    - key:  srm-public-props
      type: values
      values:
      - "proxy.host = squid-restricted-http-proxy.squid"
      - "proxy.port = 3128"
      - "proxy.nonProxyHosts = srm-to.srm.svc.cluster.local|srm-web|localhost|*.internal.codedx.com"
networkPolicy:
  web:
    egress:
      extraPorts:
        tcp: [22, 53, 80, 389, 443, 636, 7990, 7999, 8443, 3128]
```

>Note: Your egress extraPorts list may differ depending on installed features, so append 3128 as appropriate.

### Private Web Properties Proxy Example

The steps in this section show you how to configure private property values by specifying the proxy.username and proxy.password values.

1. Create a file named `srm-proxy-private-props` (no file extension) and add the proxy.username and proxy.password properties:

```
proxy.username = codedx
proxy.password = password
```

2. If necessary, pre-create the Kubernetes Software Risk Manager namespace.

```
kubectl create ns srm
```

3. Generate a Kubernetes Secret named `srm-proxy-private-props` in the Software Risk Manager namespace. For example, if your Software Risk Manager namespace is srm, run the following command from the directory containing srm-proxy-creds-props:

```
kubectl -n srm create secret generic srm-proxy-private-props --from-file=srm-proxy-private-props
```

4. Edit your `srm-extra-props.yaml` file you created in the previous section and add a reference to the srm-proxy-private-props Kubernetes Secret you just created by appending an entry named srm-proxy-private-props to the extra array (last three lines shown below under web.props.extra):

```
web:
  props:
    extra:
    - key:  srm-public-props
      type: values
      values:
      - "proxy.host = squid-restricted-http-proxy.squid"
      - "proxy.port = 3128"
      - "proxy.nonProxyHosts = srm-to.srm.svc.cluster.local|srm-web|localhost|*.internal.codedx.com"
    - key: srm-proxy-private-props
      type: secret
      name: srm-proxy-private-props
networkPolicy:
  web:
    egress:
      extraPorts:
        tcp: [22, 53, 80, 389, 443, 636, 7990, 7999, 8443, 3128]
```

## Specify Database Connection Timeout

You can alter the database connection timeout using the web.props section of your `srm-extra-props.yaml` file. For example, you can switch from the 60-second default to a 120-second connection timeout with the following configuration:

```
web:
  props:
    limits:
      database:
        timeout: 120000
```

## Specify Extra SAML Configuration

Selecting SAML authentication in the Helm Prep Wizard will generate a config.json file with the following fields configured (field values are for illustrative purposes):

```
  ...
  "useSaml": true,
  "useLdap": false,
  "samlHostBasePath": "http://localhost:9090/srm",
  "samlIdentityProviderMetadataPath": "/path/to/idp-metadata.xml",
  "samlAppName": "srm-app",
  "samlKeystorePwd": "password",
  "samlPrivateKeyPwd": "password",
  ...
```

Running helm-prep.ps1 with a config.json file like the above will generate a Software Risk Manager props file with the following SAML properties:

- auth.saml2.identityProviderMetadataPath
- auth.saml2.entityId
- auth.saml2.keystorePassword
- auth.saml2.privateKeyPassword
- auth.hostBasePath

If you want to configure additional SAML properties described in the Software Risk Manager Install Guide, add them to your srm-extra-props.yaml file. 

>Note: Refer to the [Customizing Software Risk Manager](#customizing-software-risk-manager) section if you are unfamiliar with an srm-extra-props.yaml file.

Here's an example srm-extra-props.yaml with two SAML-specific props:

```
web:
  props:
    extra:
    - type: values
      key: srm-public-props
      values:
      - "ui.auth.samlLabel = Keycloak"
      - "auth.autoExternalRedirect = false"
```

## Specify LDAP Configuration

1. Complete the Helm Prep Wizard to generate the config.json file suitable for your Software Risk Manager deployment and invoke the resulting run-helm-prep.ps1 script.

2. Create a file named srm-ldap-private-props and add your LDAP props values. For example, you can set the LDAP URL, systemUsername, systemPassword, and authenticationMechanism by adding these values to your srm-ldap-private-props file:

```
auth.ldap.url = ldap://10.0.1.27
auth.ldap.systemUsername = CN=Code Dx Service Account,CN=Managed Service Accounts,DC=dc,DC=codedx,DC=local
auth.ldap.systemPassword = ************
auth.ldap.authenticationMechanism = simple
```

Note: If you plan to use LDAPS, switch `ldap://` to `ldaps://`, and, if necessary, add your LDAP server certificate to the web component's cacerts file.

3. If necessary, pre-create the Kubernetes Software Risk Manager namespace.

```
kubectl create ns srm
```

4. Generate a Kubernetes secret named srm-ldap-private-props in your Software Risk Manager namespace. For example, if your namespace is srm, run the following command from the directory containing srm-ldap-private-props:

```
kubectl -n srm create secret generic srm-ldap-private-props --from-file=srm-ldap-private-props
```

5. Reference your srm-ldap-private-props Kubernetes secret by adding a new entry to your srm-extra-props.yaml file.

```
web:
  props:
    extra:
    - key: srm-ldap-private-props
      type: secret
      name: srm-ldap-private-props
```

>Note: Refer to the [Customizing Software Risk Manager](#customizing-software-risk-manager) section if you are unfamiliar with an srm-extra-props.yaml file.

## Specify Custom Context Path

By default, Software Risk Manager is accessible at `/srm`. For backward compatibility, requests to `/codedx/api` and `/codedx/x` will be rewritten to `/srm/api` and `/srm/x` respectively, and requests to `/codedx` will be redirected to /srm.

You can change Software Risk Manager's context path by setting the web.appName Helm property. URL rewrites and redirects from /codedx get disabled when using a custom context path. Here's an example srm-extra-props.yaml that changes the default context path from `/srm` to `/mysrm`:

```
web:
  appName: mysrm
```

>Note: Refer to the [Customizing Software Risk Manager](#customizing-software-risk-manager) section if you are unfamiliar with an srm-extra-props.yaml file.

If you use SAML authentication, you must also update the web.authentication.saml.hostBasePath chart parameter by specifying your custom context path. Here is an example for the `/mysrm` context path where you would replace the `<hostname>` placeholder:

```
web:
  appName: mysrm
  authentication: 
    saml: 
      hostBasePath: https://<hostname>/mysrm
```

If you use the Scan Farm feature, you must also update the `cnc.scanfarm.srm.url` helm chart parameter. Here is an example for the `/mysrm` context path where you would replace `srm-web` as necessary:

```
web:
  appName: mysrm
cnc:
  scanfarm:
    srm:
      url: http://srm-web:9090/mysrm
```

>Note: Synopsys Bridge requires an /srm context path, so do not use a custom context path if you plan to use Synopsys Bridge.

If you are using the Ingress-NGINX controller, refer to this ingress resource example that uses path-based/fanout routing to make Software Risk Manager available at `/mysrm`:

```
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-read-timeout: "3600"
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-body-size: "0"
  name: srm
  namespace: srm
spec:
  ingressClassName: nginx
  rules:
  - http:
      paths:
      - backend:
          service:
            name: srm-web
            port:
              number: 9090
        path: /mysrm
        pathType: Prefix
```

## Scan Farm Job Resources

You can change the CPU and memory required for SAST and SCA scan jobs. Custom sizes are applied using helm chart values that alter Scan Service environment variables.

### SCA - Buildless Scan

To control the amount of CPU and memory used for SCA buildless scans, add the following content to your srm-extra-props.yaml file:

```
cnc:
  cnc-scan-service:
    environment:
      BLACKDUCKSCAN_CPU: cpu-in-millicores
      BLACKDUCKSCAN_MEM: memory-in-mebibytes
```

For example, to configure three vCPUs (3000m) and 3500Mi of memory, specify the following values:

```
cnc:
  cnc-scan-service:
    environment:
      BLACKDUCKSCAN_CPU: 3000
      BLACKDUCKSCAN_MEM: 3500
```

The above configuration will run on the default node pool (see [Scan Farm Node Pool requirements](#scan-farm-node-pool-requirements)), so your CPU and memory configuration must not exceed the capacity of nodes in that pool. If you want to use a custom node pool with higher capacity nodes, use the below configuration after creating a node pool with the label pool-type=custom with taint NodeType=ScannerNode (refer to [Scan Farm Node Pool requirements](#scan-farm-node-pool-requirements)).

```
cnc:
  cnc-scan-service:
    environment:
      BLACKDUCKSCAN_LABEL: "custom"
      BLACKDUCKSCAN_CPU: cpu-in-millicores
      BLACKDUCKSCAN_MEM: memory-in-mebibytes
```

### SCA - Bridge-based Scan

To control the amount of CPU and memory used for SCA scans started with Bridge, add the following content to your srm-extra-props.yaml file:

```
cnc:
  cnc-scan-service:
    environment:
      BLACKDUCKBDIO_CPU: cpu-in-millicores
      BLACKDUCKBDIO_MEM: memory-in-mebibytes
```

For example, to configure two vCPUs (2000m) and 2500Mi of memory, specify the following values:

```
cnc:
  cnc-scan-service:
    environment:
      BLACKDUCKBDIO_CPU: 2000
      BLACKDUCKBDIO_MEM: 2500
```

The above configuration will run on the default node pool (see [Scan Farm Node Pool requirements](#scan-farm-node-pool-requirements)), so your CPU and memory configuration must not exceed the capacity of nodes in that pool. If you want to use a custom node pool with higher capacity nodes, use the below configuration after creating a node pool with the label pool-type=custom with taint NodeType=ScannerNode (refer to [Scan Farm Node Pool requirements](#scan-farm-node-pool-requirements)).

```
cnc:
  cnc-scan-service:
    environment:
      BLACKDUCKBDIO_LABEL: "custom"
      BLACKDUCKBDIO_CPU: cpu-in-millicores
      BLACKDUCKBDIO_MEM: memory-in-mebibytes
```

### SAST Scan

To control the amount of CPU and memory used for SAST scans, add the following content to your srm-extra-props.yaml file:

```
cnc:
  cnc-scan-service:
    environment:
      COVCAPTURE_DEFAULTPOOLTYPE: "custom"
      COVANALYSIS_DEFAULTPOOLTYPE: "custom"
      CUSTOMNODEPOOL_LABEL: "custom"
      CUSTOMNODEPOOL_CPU: cpu-in-millicores
      CUSTOMNODEPOOL_MEM: memory-in-mebibytes
```

>Note: The above configuration references a "custom" CUSTOMNODEPOOL_LABEL, which requires a node pool having pool-type=custom with taint NodeType=ScannerNode (refer to [Scan Farm Node Pool requirements](#scan-farm-node-pool-requirements)).

For example, to configure four vCPUs (4000m) and 8000Mi of memory, specify the following values after creating a custom node pool that can support workloads of that size.

```
cnc:
  cnc-scan-service:
    environment:
      COVCAPTURE_DEFAULTPOOLTYPE: "custom"
      COVANALYSIS_DEFAULTPOOLTYPE: "custom"
      CUSTOMNODEPOOL_LABEL: "custom"
      CUSTOMNODEPOOL_CPU: 4000
      CUSTOMNODEPOOL_MEM: 8000
```

## Tool Orchestration Add-in Tool Configuration

There are four types of ConfigMaps that can contain resource requirements:

- Global
- Global Tool
- Project
- Project Tool

Software Risk Manager deployment creates the Global Resource Requirement, providing default resource requirements for tools across every project. Global Tool requirements override Global requirements for specific tools. Project requirements override Global and Global Tool requirements by providing default resource requirements for tools associated with a given project. Project Tool requirements override other requirements by specifying values for a specific tool in a particular project.

The following is an example of how the scopes can overlap:

Global Resource Requirement:
- CPU Request = 1
- CPU Limit = 4
- Memory Request = 11G
- Memory Limit = 12G

Global Tool Resource Requirement:
- CPU Request = 3

Project Resource Requirement:
- Memory Request = 13G

Project Tool Resource Requirement:
- Memory Limit = 14G

Here are the effective resource requirements resulting from the above:

Effective Resource Requirement:
- CPU Request = 3
- CPU Limit = 4
- Memory Request = 13G
- Memory Limit = 14G

The naming convention determines the scope of a resource requirement ConfigMap:

- Global: cdx-toolsvc-resource-requirements
- Global Tool: cdx-toolsvc-ToolName-resource-requirements
- Project: cdx-toolsvc-project-ProjectID-resource-requirements
- Project Tool: cdx-toolsvc-project-ProjectID-ToolName-resource-requirements

ProjectID is the integer value representing the Software Risk Manager project identifier and ToolName is the tool name converted to an acceptable k8s resource name by the following rules:

  - Uppercase letters must be converted to lowercase.
  - Any character other than a lowercase letter, number, dash, or period must be converted to a dash.
  - An initial character that is neither a number nor a lowercase letter must be preceded by the letter "s."
  - A name whose length is greater than 253, must be truncated to 253 characters.

### Add-in Example 1 - Project Resource Requirement

To create a resource requirement for all tool runs of a Software Risk Manager project represented by ID 21, create a file named cdx-toolsvc-project-21-resource-requirements.yaml and enter the following data:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: cdx-toolsvc-project-21-resource-requirements
data:
  requests.cpu: "1"
  limits.cpu: "2"
  requests.memory: "1G"
  limits.memory: "2G"
```
>Note: You can find a project's ID at the end of its Findings page URL. For example, a project with the ID 21 will have a Findings page URL that ends with /srm/projects/21.

Run the following command to create the ConfigMap resource, replacing the namespace name as necessary:

```
kubectl -n cdx-svc create -f ./cdx-toolsvc-project-21-resource-requirements.yaml
```

### Add-in Example 2 - Global Tool Resource Requirement

To create a Global Tool resource requirement for ESLint, create a file named cdx-toolsvc-eslint-resource-requirements.yaml and enter the following data:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: cdx-toolsvc-eslint-resource-requirements
data:
  requests.cpu: "2"
  limits.cpu: "3"
  requests.memory: "4G"
  limits.memory: "5G"
```

Run the following command to create the configmap resource, replacing the namespace name as necessary:

```
kubectl -n cdx-svc create -f ./cdx-toolsvc-eslint-resource-requirements.yaml
```

### Add-in Example 3 - Node Selector

To create a Global Tool resource requirement for running a tool named MyTool on cluster nodes labeled with `canrunmytool=yes`, create a file named cdx-toolsvc-mytool-resource-requirements.yaml and enter the following data:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: cdx-toolsvc-mytool-resource-requirements
data:
  nodeSelectorKey: canrunmytool
  nodeSelectorValue: yes
```

Run the following command to create the configmap resource, replacing the namespace name as necessary:

```
kubectl -n cdx-svc create -f ./cdx-toolsvc-mytool-resource-requirements.yaml
```

## Add Extra Pod Labels

You can add extra labels to pods associated with the Core and Tool Orchestration features.

>Note: Refer to the [Customizing Software Risk Manager](#customizing-software-risk-manager) section if you are unfamiliar with an srm-extra-props.yaml file.

Here's an example srm-extra-props.yaml that adds the tool=software-risk-manager label to Core and Tool Orchestration pods:

```
podLabels:
  tool: software-risk-manager
mariadb:
  podLabels:
    tool: software-risk-manager
minio:
  podLabels:
    tool: software-risk-manager
argo-workflows:
  commonLabels:
    tool: software-risk-manager
```

>Note: Your extra label(s) will apply to all labeled resources generated by the argo-workflows chart.

## Specify MySQL Server Public Key Path

Using an external database with TLS is recommended. If you plan to use an unencrypted connection to an external MySQL database with the `caching_sha2_password` default_authentication_plugin, you can specify a public key file for the RSA key pair-based password exchange.

You can find the path to your MySQL server's public key file by entering `show variables like 'caching_sha2_password_public_key_path'` at a MySQL prompt. A value without a directory path refers to a file in the server's data directory.

Copy the public key file from your MySQL server and run this command, specifying the file's location (e.g., /path/to/public_key.pem):

```
kubectl -n srm create configmap srm-web-db-public-key-configmap --from-file db-public-key=/path/to/public_key.pem
```

Reference the above Kubernetes resource in your `srm-extra-props.yaml` file:

```
web:
  database:
    publicKeyConfigMap: "srm-web-db-public-key-configmap"
```

>Note: Refer to the [Customizing Software Risk Manager](#customizing-software-risk-manager) section if you are unfamiliar with an srm-extra-props.yaml file.

# Maintenance

Refer to this section for details on operating your Software Risk Manager deployment.

## System Component Password/Key Resets

Software Risk Manager workloads mount system passwords and API keys from Kubernetes Secrets established at deployment time. Some workloads can use a new password/key by restarting after updating a Kubernetes Secret resource on which they depend. Other workloads require a component-specific procedure followed by a corresponding update to related Kubernetes Secret resources.

If you previously deployed Software Risk Manager using the Quick Start method, you must switch to the Full Installation at this time. You can create a new config.json file by running the New Config script.

```
$ cd /path/to/srm-k8s
$ pwsh ps/features/new-config.ps1
```

You can update passwords and keys for the Software Risk Manager Core and Tool Orchestration features by using the Set Passwords wizard.

```
$ cd /path/to/srm-k8s
$ pwsh ps/features/set-passwords.ps1 -configPath /path/to/work/directory/config.json
```

## Expand Volume Size

Before expanding the volume size of a Software Risk Manager volume, verify that you are using a [storage class configured for volume expansion](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/storage-classes/#allow-volume-expansion). The number of volumes you have in your Software Risk Manage deployment depends on what features you installed and how they were configured. This section assumes that you installed both the Core and Tool Orchestration features, opting for on-cluster database and object storage workloads, but you can ignore content that does not apply to your deployment.

Expanding the on-cluster MariaDB database volumes requires special care because the workload resources use immutable database size references. Follow these steps to handle the necessary pre-work for MariaDB:

1. Scale the StatefulSet resources for the master and replica (if installed) to 0
2. Delete the StatefulSet resources for the master and replica (if installed), but do *not* delete the related PVC resources
3. Edit the PVC resources for the master, replica (if installed), and replica backup (if installed), setting the storage capacity to the new size. If using the System Size feature, refer to the System Size tables to determine the new sizes.
4. Invoke the describe command on each PVC to review resize-related Kubernetes events and conditions to know when to move on.

If you used the Helm Prep Script and the System Size feature, edit your config.json by changing the value of the systemSize field and rerun your run-helm-prep.ps1 script and related helm commands.

If you used the Helm Prep Script and did not use the System Size feature, edit your config.json by changing these fields: `webVolumeSizeGiB`, `dbVolumeSizeGiB`, `dbSlaveVolumeSizeGiB`, `dbSlaveBackupVolumeSizeGiB`, and `minioVolumeSizeGiB`. Then rerun your run-helm-prep.ps1 script and related helm commands.

If you used the Quick Start deployment, either include the following helm chart values in your srm-extra-props.yaml file or specify them with "--set" parameters, and rerun your helm command: `web.persistence.size`, `mariadb.master.persistence.size`, `mariadb.slave.persistence.size`, `mariadb.slave.persistence.backup.size`, and `minio.persistence.size`.

## Reset Replication

You can use an external MariaDB/MySQL database with Software Risk Manager or the on-cluster MariaDB database configuration with an optional replica database supporting system backups.

When replication is enabled, you can run the `SHOW REPLICA STATUS \G;` command on the replica to confirm that data replication is running correctly. If you observe an error with MariaDB replication, you can reset data replication using the below procedure. You will use three terminal windows to reset replication.

>Note: The steps in the following section assume two statefulsets, srm-mariadb-master and srm-mariadb-slave, and an srm-web deployment, all in the srm namespace. They also assume that you have a single replica instance, as you would not want to run RESET MASTER with other replicas in replication.

Terminal 1 (Stop web workload):

1.	kubectl -n srm scale --replicas=0 deployment/srm-web

Terminal 1 (Stop replication on replica):

2.	kubectl -n srm exec -it srm-mariadb-slave-0 -- bash
3.	mysql -uroot -p
4.	STOP SLAVE;
5.	exit # mysql
6.  exit # pod

Terminal 2 (Prepare for primary backup)

7.	kubectl -n srm exec -it srm-mariadb-master-0 -- bash
    >Note: Confirm zero database writers
8.	mysql -uroot -p
9.	RESET MASTER;
    >Note: RESET MASTER deletes previous binary log files, creating a new binary log file.
10.	FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK;
11. SHOW MASTER STATUS;
    >Note: Record starting position in master log

Terminal 3 (Create primary backup):

12.	kubectl -n srm exec -it srm-mariadb-master-0 -- bash
13.	mysqldump -u root -p codedx > /bitnami/mariadb/codedx-dump.sql
    >Note: The above command assumes you have adequate space at /bitnami/mariadb to store your database backup. Use an alternate path as necessary, and adjust paths in subsequent steps accordingly.
14.	exit # pod
15.	exit # terminal

Terminal 2 (Unlock primary tables):

16.	UNLOCK TABLES;
17.	exit # mysql

Terminal 1 (Move primary backup to replica):

18.	kubectl -n srm cp srm-mariadb-master-0:/bitnami/mariadb/codedx-dump.sql ./codedx-dump.sql
19.	kubectl -n srm cp ./codedx-dump.sql srm-mariadb-slave-0:/bitnami/mariadb/codedx-dump.sql

>Note: Above commands are one option for moving the backup from the primary to the replica.

Terminal 2 (Delete primary backup):

20.	kubectl -n srm exec srm-mariadb-master-0 -- rm /bitnami/mariadb/codedx-dump.sql
21.	exit # terminal

Terminal 1 (Restore replication):

22. kubectl -n srm exec -it srm-mariadb-slave-0 -- bash
23.	mysql -u root -p codedx < /bitnami/mariadb/codedx-dump.sql
24.	mysql -uroot -p
25.	RESET SLAVE;
    >Note: RESET SLAVE deletes relay log files.
26. Remove old binary log files by running "SHOW BINARY LOGS;" and "PURGE BINARY LOGS TO 'name';"
    >Note: If you previously deleted binary log files (mysql-bin.000*) from the file system, remove the contents of the mysql-bin.index text file.
27.	CHANGE MASTER TO MASTER_LOG_FILE='mysql-bin.000001', MASTER_LOG_POS=position-from-step-11-goes-here;
    >Note: Replace position-from-step-11-goes-here before running the above command.
28.	START SLAVE;
29.	SHOW SLAVE STATUS \G;
30.	exit # mysql
31.	rm /bitnami/mariadb/codedx-dump.sql
32.	exit # pod

Terminal 1 (Start web workload):

33. kubectl -n srm scale --replicas=1 deployment/srm-web
34.	exit # terminal

## Web Logging

The Software Risk Manager Web component writes log messages to its log file and standard out using [Logback](https://logback.qos.ch/manual/introduction.html). The component's Logback configuration file gets mounted at /opt/codedx/logback.xml and looks like this:

```
<configuration>
  <appender name="logFile" class="ch.qos.logback.core.rolling.RollingFileAppender">
    <file>${codedx.log.dir}/codedx.log</file>
    <rollingPolicy class="ch.qos.logback.core.rolling.TimeBasedRollingPolicy">
      <!-- rollover daily -->
      <fileNamePattern>${codedx.log.dir}/codedx-%d{yyyy-MM-dd}.%i.log</fileNamePattern>
      <timeBasedFileNamingAndTriggeringPolicy class="ch.qos.logback.core.rolling.SizeAndTimeBasedFNATP">
        <!-- or whenever the file size reaches 100MB -->
        <maxFileSize>100MB</maxFileSize>
      </timeBasedFileNamingAndTriggeringPolicy>
      <!-- keep 7 days worth of history -->
      <maxHistory>7</maxHistory>
      <cleanHistoryOnStart>true</cleanHistoryOnStart>
    </rollingPolicy>
    <encoder>
      <pattern>%-5level %d{yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.SSS} [%thread] %logger{36} - %msg%n</pattern>
    </encoder>
  </appender>
  <appender name="stdout" class="ch.qos.logback.core.ConsoleAppender">
    <encoder>
      <pattern>%-5level %d{yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.SSS} [%thread] %logger{36} - %msg%n</pattern>
    </encoder>
  </appender>
  <logger name="net.liftweb" level="WARN" />
  <root level="INFO">
    <appender-ref ref="logFile" />
    <appender-ref ref="stdout" />
  </root>
</configuration>
```
You can alter the configuration file with the following procedure:

1. Save your configuration file to /path/to/srm-k8s-work-dir/logback.xml

2. Create a new ConfigMap containing your configuration file by running the following command, replacing the namespace as necessary:

```
kubectl -n srm create configmap srm-web-logging-cfgmap --from-file logback.xml=/path/to/srm-k8s-work-dir/logback.xml
```

3. If you already have an srm-extra-props.yaml file, merge the below content into your existing file. Otherwise, create your srm-extra-props.yaml file (see [Customizing Software Risk Manager](#customizing-software-risk-manager)) and add the following content:

```
web:
  loggingConfigMap: srm-web-logging-cfgmap
```

4. Refer to [Customizing Software Risk Manager](#customizing-software-risk-manager) for how to rerun helm with your srm-extra-props.yaml file.

# Backup and Restore

Software Risk Manager depends on [Velero](https://velero.io) for cluster state and volume data backups. When not using an external web database, you must deploy with at least one MariaDB subordinate database so that a database backup occurs before Velero runs a backup.

If you are using an external web database, your database will not be included in the Velero-based backup. You must create a database backup schedule on your own. To minimize data loss, schedule your database backups to coincide with your cluster backups to help align your Kubernetes volume and database data after a restore.

> Note: The overall backup process is not an atomic operation, so it's possible to capture inconsistent state in a backup. For example, the web AppData volume backup could include a file that was unknown at the time the database backup occurred. The likelihood of capturing inconsistent state is a function of multiple factors including system activity and the duration of backup operations.

## About Velero

Velero can back up Kubernetes state stored in etcd and Kubernetes volume data. Volume data gets backed up using either [storage provider plugins](https://velero.io/docs/main/supported-providers/), or Velero's integration with [Restic](https://restic.net/) or [Kopia](https://kopia.io/). Refer to [How Velero Works](https://velero.io/docs/main/how-velero-works/), [How Velero integrates with Restic](https://velero.io/docs/main/file-system-backup/#how-velero-integrates-with-restic), and [How Velero integrates with Kopia](https://velero.io/docs/main/file-system-backup/#how-velero-integrates-with-kopia) for more details.

> Note: Use Velero's Restic or Kopia integration when a storage provider plugin is unavailable for your environment.

## Installing Velero

Install the [Velero CLI](https://velero.io/docs/main/basic-install/#install-the-cli) and then follow the Velero installation documentation for your scenario. You can find links to provider-specific documentation in the Setup Instructions column on the [Providers](https://velero.io/docs/main/supported-providers/) page, which includes links to the [Azure](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/velero-plugin-for-microsoft-azure#setup) and [AWS](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/velero-plugin-for-aws#setup) instructions. If you're not using a storage provider plugin, [enable file system backup](https://velero.io/docs/main/customize-installation/#enable-file-system-backup) at install time.

> Note: If your Velero backup unexpectedly fails, you may need to increase the amount of memory available to the Velero pod. Use the --velero-pod-mem-limit parameter with the velero install command as described [here](https://velero.io/docs/main/customize-installation/#customize-resource-requests-and-limits).

### Velero Opt-In or Opt-Out Volume Backup

If your Velero configuration requires opt-in (velero.io/backup-name=volume-name) or opt-out (velero.io/backup-volumes-excludes=volume-name) volume annotations, you can [customize your Software Risk Manager deployment](#customizing-software-risk-manager) by specifying pod annotations as shown below (opt-in example). Replace the volume name placeholders with your volume names.

```
web:
  podAnnotations:
    backup.velero.io/backup-volumes: appdata-volume-name

mariadb:
  slave:
    annotations:
      backup.velero.io/backup-volumes: backup-volume-name

minio:
  podAnnotations:
    backup.velero.io/backup-volumes: minio-volume-name
```

## Create a Backup Schedule

After installing Velero, you can create a [Schedule resource](https://velero.io/docs/main/api-types/schedule/).

### Schedule for On-Cluster Database

If you are using an on-cluster Software Risk Manager database, create a Schedule resource using the following YAML, replacing namespace names `velero` and `srm` as necessary.

```
apiVersion: velero.io/v1
kind: Schedule
metadata:
  name: srm-schedule
  namespace: velero
spec:
  schedule: 0 3 * * *
  template:
    hooks:
      resources:
      - includedNamespaces:
        - srm
        labelSelector:
          matchLabels:
            app: mariadb
            component: slave
        name: database-backup
        pre:
        - exec:
            command:
            - /bin/bash
            - -c
            - /bitnami/mariadb/scripts/backup.sh && sleep 1m
            container: mariadb
            timeout: 30m
    includeClusterResources: true
    includedNamespaces:
    - srm
    storageLocation: default
    ttl: 720h0m0s
```

>Note: The above Schedule requires a replica Software Risk Manager database whose backup.sh script will be invoked as a pre-backup hook.

### Schedule for External Database

If you are using an external Software Risk Manager database, create a Schedule resource using the following YAML, replacing namespace names `velero` and `srm` as necessary. Ensure that the external database backup occurs at the same time indicated by `spec.schedule`.

```
apiVersion: velero.io/v1
kind: Schedule
metadata:
  name: srm-schedule
  namespace: velero
spec:
  schedule: 0 3 * * *
  template:
    includeClusterResources: true
    includedNamespaces:
    - srm
    storageLocation: default
    ttl: 720h0m0s
```

## Verify Backup

Once backups start running, use the velero commands that [describe backups and fetch logs](https://velero.io/docs/v1.5/troubleshooting/#general-troubleshooting-information) to confirm that the backups are completing successfully and that they include Software Risk Manager volumes.

When using Velero with Storage Provider Plugins, the volume snapshots initiated by a plugin may finish after the Backup resource reports a completed status. Wait for the volume snapshot process to finish before starting a restore.

If applicable, you should also confirm that the database backup script runs correctly and produces database backups with each Velero backup in the /bitnami/mariadb/backup/data directory. Use the following command after replacing placeholder parameters to list recent backups for a MariaDB subordinate database instance:

```
$ kubectl -n srm-namespace-placeholder exec srm-mariadb-slave-pod-placeholder -- ls /bitnami/mariadb/backup/data
```

> Note: Older backup files get removed from the database volume when backups complete.

You can use this command to view the backup log on a MariaDB slave database instance.

```
$ kubectl -n srm-namespace-placeholder exec srm-mariadb-slave-pod-placeholder -- cat /bitnami/mariadb/backup/data/backup.log
```

The backup.log file should have a "completed OK!" message above the log entries indicating that old backups are getting removed.

> Note: To confirm that a backup includes the volume holding your Software Risk Manager database backup, test a backup by running a restore.

You should periodically check your Velero backups based on your backup schedule to ensure that backups are succeeding.

## Restoring Code Dx

Velero will skip restoring resources that already exist, so delete those you want to restore from a backup. You can delete the Software Risk Manager namespace to remove all namespaced resources, and you can delete cluster scoped Software Risk Manager resources to remove Software Risk Manager entirely. Since Software Risk Manager depends on multiple PersistentVolume (PV) resources, you will typically want to delete Software Risk Manager PVs when restoring Software Risk Manager to a previous known good state.

There are two steps required to restore Software Risk Manager from a Velero backup. The first step is to use the velero CLI to restore a specific backup. For the second step, you will run the restore-db.ps1 script to restore a local Software Risk Manager database. If you're using an external database, you will skip the second step by restoring your Software Risk Manager database on your own.

>Note: When using Velero with Storage Provider Plugins, wait for the volume snapshot process to finish before restoring a backup.

### Step 1: Restore Cluster State and Volume Data

During Step 1, you will use Velero to restore cluster and volume state from an existing backup. You can see a list of available backups by running the following command:

```
$ velero get backup
```

Assuming you want to restore a backup named 'my-backup', run the following command to install the PriorityClass resources from that backup:

```
$ velero restore create --from-backup my-backup --include-resources=PriorityClass
```

Wait for the restore started by the previous command to finish. You can use the describe command it prints to check progress.

A restore may finish with warnings and errors indicating that one or more resources could not be restored. Velero will not delete resources during a restore, so you may see warnings about Velero failing to create resources that already exist. Review any warnings and errors displayed by Velero's describe and log commands to determine whether they can be ignored.

> Note: You can use Velero's log command to view the details of a restore after it completes.

After waiting for the restore operation to finish, run the following command to restore the remaining resources from your backup:

```
$ velero restore create --from-backup my-backup
```

> Note: Running two velero commands works around an issue discovered in Velero v1.3.2 that blocks the restoration of Software Risk Manager pods. If you run only the second command, Software Risk Manager priority classes get restored, but pods depending on those classes do not.

When using Velero with storage provider plugins, your Software Risk Manager and MariaDB pods may not return to a running state. Step 2 will resolve that issue.

> Note: Software Risk Manager is not ready for use at the end of Step 1.

### Step 2: Restore Software Risk Manager Database

During Step 2, you will run the admin/restore-db.ps1 script to restore the Software Risk Manager database from a backup residing on the volume data you restored. If you are using an external Software Risk Manager database, restore your external database to a time that coincides with your Software Risk Manager backup and skip this section.

At this point, you can find the database backup corresponding to the backup you want to restore. Refer to the Verify Backup section for the command to list backup files on a MariaDB slave database instance. Note the name of the database backup that coincides with the Velero backup you restored (e.g., '20200523-020200-Full'). You will enter this name when prompted by the restore-db.ps1 script.

You must add both the helm and kubectl programs to your path before running the restore database script. Start a new PowerShell Core 7 session and change directory to where you downloaded the setup scripts from the [srm-k8s repository](https://github.com/synopsys-sig/srm-k8s).

```
/$ pwsh
PS /> cd ~/git/srm-k8s/admin
```

Start the restore-db.ps1 script by running the following command after replacing parameter placeholders:

```
PS /git/srm-k8s/admin> ./restore-db.ps1 `
        -namespaceCodeDx 'srm-namespace-placeholder' `
        -releaseNameCodeDx 'srm-helm-release-name-placeholder'
```

> Note: You can pull the Software Risk Manager Restore Database Docker image from an alternate Docker registry using the -imageDatabaseRestore parameter and from a private Docker registry by adding the -dockerImagePullSecretName parameter.

When prompted by the script, enter the name of the database backup you want to restore and the passwords for the MariaDB database root and replicator users. The script will search for the database backup, copy it to a folder in your profile, and use the backup to restore both master and slave database(s). It will then restart database replication, and it will manage the running instances of MariaDB and Software Risk Manager, so when the script is finished, all Software Risk Manager pods will be online. Depending on your ingress type and what was restored, you may need to update your DNS configuration before using the new Software Risk Manager instance.

> Note: The restore-db.ps1 script requires that your work directory (default is your profile directory) not already include a folder named backup-files. The script will stop if it finds that directory, so delete it before starting the script.

## Removing Backup Configuration

If you need to uninstall the backup configuration and Velero, do the following:

- Remove the Velero Schedule resource for your Software Risk Manager instance and related Backup and Restore resources (you can remove *all* Velero backup and restore objects by running `velero backup delete --all` and `velero restore delete --all`)
- [Uninstall Velero](https://velero.io/docs/main/uninstalling/)

## Reset Database Replication

Velero backups configured with an on-cluster MariaDB Web database depend on properly functioning replication. You can run the following command on a MariaDB replica database to see the replication status:

```
$ mysql -uroot -p
Enter password:
MariaDB [(none)]> SHOW REPLICA STATUS \G;
```

If the replication state shows an error permanently blocking data from moving between the primary and replica instances, replication should be reset to ensure proper backups. You can reset replication with the following steps that use four different terminal windows.

>Note: The steps assume two statefulsets named srm-mariadb-master and srm-mariadb-slave and a deployment named srm-web in the srm namespace with one subordinate database. It also assumes a database named codedx.

Terminal 1 (Subordinate DB):

1.	kubectl -n srm scale --replicas=0 deployment/srm-web
2.	kubectl -n srm exec -it srm-mariadb-slave-0 -- bash
3.	mysql -uroot -p
4.	STOP SLAVE;
5.	exit # mysql

Terminal 2 (Master DB):

6.	kubectl -n srm exec -it srm-mariadb-master-0 -- bash
7.	mysql -uroot -p
8.	RESET MASTER;
>Note: RESET MASTER deletes previous binary log files, creating a new binary log file.
9.	FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK;

Terminal 3 (Master DB):

10.	kubectl -n srm exec -it srm-mariadb-master-0 -- bash
11.	mysqldump -u root -p codedx > /bitnami/mariadb/srm-dump.sql

>Note: The above command assumes you have adequate space at /bitnami/mariadb to store your database backup. Use an alternate path as necessary, and adjust paths in subsequent steps accordingly.

Terminal 2 (Master DB)

12.	UNLOCK TABLES;

Terminal 4:

13.	kubectl -n srm cp srm-mariadb-master-0:/bitnami/mariadb/srm-dump.sql ./srm-dump.sql
14.	kubectl -n srm cp ./srm-dump.sql srm-mariadb-slave-0:/bitnami/mariadb/srm-dump.sql

Terminal 1 (Subordinate DB):

15.	mysql -u root -p codedx < /bitnami/mariadb/srm-dump.sql
16.	mysql -uroot -p
17.	RESET SLAVE;
>Note: RESET SLAVE deletes relay log files.
18. Remove old binary log files by running "SHOW BINARY LOGS;" and "PURGE BINARY LOGS TO 'name';"
>Note: If you previously deleted binary log files (mysql-bin.000*) from the file system, remove the contents of the mysql-bin.index text file.
19.	CHANGE MASTER TO MASTER_LOG_FILE='mysql-bin.000001', MASTER_LOG_POS=1;
20.	START SLAVE;
21.	SHOW SLAVE STATUS \G;
22.	exit # mysql
23.	rm /bitnami/mariadb/srm-dump.sql
24.	exit # pod
25.	exit # terminal

Terminal 2 (Master DB):

26.	exit # mysql
27.	rm /bitnami/mariadb/srm-dump.sql
28.	exit # pod
29.	exit # terminal

Terminal 3 (Master DB):

30.	exit # pod
31.	exit # terminal

Terminal 4:

32.	kubectl -n srm scale --replicas=1 deployment/srm-web
33.	exit # terminal

# Upgrades

Software Risk Manager has four major releases typically spaced evenly throughout the year. Minor releases are published on the second Tuesday of each month, with hotfixes released as needed. Updates to the Software Risk Manager Core feature get advertised with a notification in the Software Risk Manager web interface.

## Applying an Update

The [srm-k8s GitHub repository](https://github.com/synopsys-sig/srm-k8s) is updated with each Software Risk Manager release. Additional Kubernetes-specific releases may occur between planned Software Risk Manager releases. Each release has a version number based on [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) with release notes published on the [releases page](https://github.com/synopsys-sig/srm-k8s/releases). 

>Note: It is essential to read release notes associated with releases introducing breaking changes.

The Helm chart version number (i.e., the chart's version field) will always reference an associated srm-k8s release, and the chart's appVersion field will always reference the version number of the associated Software Risk Manager Core feature.

A Software Risk Manager upgrade typically starts by updating your repository clone. If you open your run-helm-prep.ps1 script, you'll notice how it points to the Helm Prep Script in your repo clone. Rerunning your run-helm-prep.ps1 script reruns the Helm Prep script version associated with the Software Risk Manager version you're upgrading to, and that will generate kubectl/helm commands suitable for your upgraded instance.

>Note: You will not rerun the Helm Prep Wizard when upgrading Software Risk Manager.

An upgrade occurs with this four-step process:

1. Pull the latest from this GitHub Repository
   ```
   $ cd /path/to/git/srm-k8s
   $ git pull
   ```
   >Note: The above command assumes you are upgrading to the latest version. You can update to a specific version by running `git checkout version-number` instead.

2. If you previously pulled Software Risk Manager Docker images from the Synopsys Docker registry or you copied Docker images from Docker Hub to your private Docker registry, refer to the [registry deployment script](deploy/registry.md) to re-pull/push required Docker images.

3. Rerun the Helm Prep Script
   ```
   $ cd /path/to/srm-k8s-work-dir # the directory you entered into the Helm Prep Wizard - see your config.json's workDir field
   $ pwsh ./run-helm-prep.ps1
   ```

4. Follow the instructions printed by the Helm Prep script and rerun the printed helm/kubectl commands

### TLS

The TLS configuration for the Scan Farm Cache Service and the optional inter-component TLS will get regenerated during a helm install or upgrade. It may be necessary to restart pods configured for TLS if they do not restart during a helm upgrade.

## Adding the Scan Farm Feature

You can add the Scan Farm feature to an existing Software Risk Manager deployment, provided that you are using the latest deployment model (srm-k8s, not codedx-kubernetes). You will update your config.json file by running the Add Scan Farm Wizard. Next, you will rerun the Helm Prep Script via your run-helm-prep.ps1 script and invoke the recommended helm and kubectl commands.

>Note: The Add Scan Farm Wizard will create a backup of your config.json file by saving a copy with the file extension `.json.bak`.

You should complete all of the [Scan Farm Pre-work](#scan-farm-pre-work) before running the add-scanfarm.ps1 script.

```
$ cd /path/to/srm-k8s
$ pwsh ps/features/add-scanfarm.ps1 -configPath /path/to/work/directory/config.json
```

## Reconfigure the Scan Farm Feature

You can run the Add Scan Farm Wizard to reconfigure the Scan Farm feature. The wizard will update your config.json file so that you can rerun the Helm Prep Script via your run-helm-prep.ps1 script and invoke the recommended helm and kubectl commands.

>Note: The Add Scan Farm Wizard will create a backup of your config.json file by saving a copy with the file extension `.json.bak`.

You should complete all of the [Scan Farm Pre-work](#scan-farm-pre-work) before running the add-scanfarm.ps1 script.

```
$ cd /path/to/srm-k8s
$ pwsh ps/features/add-scanfarm.ps1 -configPath /path/to/work/directory/config.json
```

## Trusting Additional Certificates

You can have the Software Risk Manager web pod trust additional certificates by running the Add Trusted Certificates Wizard to update your config.json file before rerunning the Helm Prep Script via your run-helm-prep.ps1 script and invoking the recommended helm command.

>Note: The Add Trusted Certificates Wizard will create a backup of your config.json file by saving a copy with the file extension `.json.bak`.

```
$ cd /path/to/srm-k8s
$ pwsh ps/features/add-trustedcerts.ps1 -configPath /path/to/work/directory/config.json
```

## Adding SAML Authentication

You can opt for SAML authentication when you run the Helm Prep Wizard. If you did not, you can alter your Software Risk Manager configuration to authenticate users against a SAML 2.0 IdP (Identity Provider) by running the Add SAML Authentication Wizard. The wizard will update your config.json file, allowing you to rerun the Helm Prep Script via your run-helm-prep.ps1 script and invoke the recommended helm command to apply your SAML configuration.

>Note: The Add SAML Authentication Wizard will create a backup of your config.json file by saving a copy with the file extension `.json.bak`.

```
$ cd /path/to/srm-k8s
$ pwsh ps/features/add-samlauth.ps1 -configPath /path/to/work/directory/config.json
```

# Code Dx Deployment Model Migration

Code Dx was renamed the Software Risk Manager with the 2023.8.0 release, which introduced a new deployment model that supports a separately licensed Scan Farm feature with built-in SAST and SCA scanning powered by Coverity and Black Duck.

The new deployment model differs from the legacy one in the following ways:

| Deployment Detail | Old Model | New Model |
|:-|:-:|:-:|
| Wizard | Guided Setup | Helm Prep Wizard |
| Script | Deployment Script | Helm Prep Script |
| Requires Connected Cluster | Yes | No |
||||
| Git Repo | [codedx-kubernetes](https://github.com/codedx/codedx-kubernetes) | [srm-k8s](https://github.com/synopsys-sig/srm-k8s) |
| Chart Repo | n/a | https://synopsys-sig.github.io/srm-k8s |
||||
| Helm Charts | 2 | 1 |
| Namespaces | 2 | 1 |
||||
| Core Feature | Yes | Yes |
| Tool Orchestration Feature | Yes | Yes |
| Scan Farm Feature | No | Yes |
||||
| Manual Helm Deployment | Yes | Yes |
| Automated Helm Deployment | Yes | No |
| Flux v1 GitOps Deployment | Yes | No |
| Flux v2 GitOps Deployment | Yes | Yes |
| YAML Deployment | Yes | No |
||||
| Pre-work Deployment Guide | No | Yes |
| Quick Start Deployments | 0 | 2 |
| Full Deployment Prereqs | 7 | 3 |
| Full Deployment Configuration | run-setup.ps1 parameters | config.json file (conditionally password-protected) |

The legacy deployment model available at [codedx-kubernetes](https://github.com/codedx/codedx-kubernetes) contains the Guided Setup that you previously ran to populate your initial run-setup.ps1 file with the Code Dx Deployment Script parameters suitable for your Code Dx installation. This section explains how to switch from the legacy deployment model to the new one, using your run-setup.ps1 as input into the migration process.

Installing Software Risk Manager from scratch without a data migration is a four-step process:

- Clone this GitHub Repository
- Run the Helm Prep Wizard (once)
- Run the Helm Prep Script
- Invoke helm/kubectl Commands

Migrating from your legacy Code Dx deployment to Software Risk Manager requires these steps:

- Clone this GitHub Repository
- Run the Software Risk Manager Migration Script
- Run the Helm Prep Script
- Invoke helm/kubectl Commands (to install a brand-new, empty system)
- Copy Code Dx Data to Software Risk Manager

Note how the Software Risk Manager Migration Script replaces the Helm Prep Wizard and how the migration process has an extra step to copy data between your Code Dx and Software Risk Manager deployments.

In the new deployment model, the Helm Prep Wizard replaces the Code Dx Guided Setup. Whereas the Guided Setup stored Deployment Script parameters in a run-setup.ps1 file, the wizard generates a config.json file with your deployment parameters. The Helm Prep Script replaces the Code Dx Deployment script and takes as input the config.json file generated by the wizard.

You will not run the Helm Prep Wizard when migrating your Code Dx deployment because your Software Risk Manager configuration gets inferred from the content of your legacy deployment's run-setup.ps1 script.

## Before you Begin

Before you get started, make sure that you have satisified the Software Risk Manager deployment [prerequisites](#prerequisites) and understand the [requirements](#requirements).

Back up your Code Dx system now so that you can restore its state should something go wrong with your data migration.

>Note: Data migration for external workflow storage is unsupported because it will be reused with your Software Risk Manager deployment. Contact Synopsys if you would like guidance on how to avoid reuse for external workflow storage.

## Clone the srm-k8s GitHub Repository

The [srm-k8s GitHub repository](https://github.com/synopsys-sig/srm-k8s) includes the scripts you need to migrate from the Code Dx deployment model to the Software Risk Manager one. Run the following command to clone the repository by fetching the files required to install the latest Software Risk Manager release:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/synopsys-sig/srm-k8s
$ cd /path/to/git/srm-k8s
```

## Upgrade your Code Dx Version

If your legacy Code Dx version differs from the Software Risk Manager version you plan to install, upgrade your Code Dx system to match the Software Risk Manager version before you continue. For example, if you are running Code Dx 2023.4.0 and planning to install Software Risk Manager 2024.6.0, upgrade your Code Dx 2023.4.0 system to Code Dx 2024.6.0 before continuing. Since the 2024.6.0 upgrade may involve data migrations and other upgrades, avoid conflating those upgrade activities with your migration to the Software Risk Manager Helm chart.

Verify that your upgraded Code Dx system works as expected, and then back up your Code Dx system so that you can restore its state should something go wrong with your migration.

## Stop Code Dx Web

You must turn off the Code Dx Web workload, leaving it offline during the migration process.

1) Scale down your source Code Dx web workload, replacing the `cdx-app` namespace and `codedx` deployment name as necessary:

```
$ kubectl -n cdx-app scale --replicas=0 deployment/codedx
```

## Stop Code Dx Tool Orchestration (if installed)

You must turn off Code Dx Tool Orchestration workloads, leaving them offline during the migration process.

1) Scale down your source Code Dx Tool Orchestration workloads, replacing the `cdx-svc` namespace, `codedx-tool-orchestration` and `codedx-tool-orchestration-minio` deployment names as necessary:

```
$ kubectl -n cdx-svc scale --replicas=0 deployment/codedx-tool-orchestration
$ kubectl -n cdx-svc scale --replicas=0 deployment/codedx-tool-orchestration-minio
```

## Run the Software Risk Manager Migration Script

Your Code Dx to Software Risk Manager migration starts with the migrate.ps1 script whose command-line interface matches the Code Dx deployment script parameters you will find in your run-setup.ps1 file.

Locate your run-setup.ps1 file before continuing. The script should be runnable from its current location. For example, any files it references must be present on your local system.

Make a copy of your run-setup.ps1 file:

```
$ cp /path/to/run-setup.ps1 /path/to/run-migrate.ps1
```

Edit run-migrate.ps1 by prepending the path to the migrate.ps1 script (e.g., `/path/to/git/srm-k8s/admin/migrate/migrate.ps1`) followed by ` -codeDxSetupScriptPath`. For example, your edited file will look like this:

```
/path/to/git/srm-k8s/admin/migrate/migrate.ps1 -codeDxSetupScriptPath /path/to/git/codedx-kubernetes/setup/steps/../core/setup.ps1 -workDir '/home/user/.k8s-codedx' -kubeContextName 'cluster' -kubeApiTargetPort '443' -namespaceCodeDx 'cdx-app' -releaseNameCodeDx 'codedx' ...
```

Before continuing, verify that the `-codeDxAdminPwd` parameter value matches the current admin password for your Code Dx instance. If the password matches the initial admin password, update the parameter by specifying the current password.

```
/path/to/git/srm-k8s/admin/migrate/migrate.ps1 -codeDxSetupScriptPath /path/to/git/codedx-kubernetes/setup/steps/../core/setup.ps1 -workDir '/home/user/.k8s-codedx' -kubeContextName 'cluster' -kubeApiTargetPort '443' -namespaceCodeDx 'cdx-app' -releaseNameCodeDx 'codedx' -codeDxAdminPwd 'current-admin-password-goes-here' ... 
```

Invoke your run-migrate.ps1 script to generate a config.json file.

```
$ pwsh /path/to/run-migrate.ps1
```

>Note: You should specify a new, unique namespace and release name to avoid conflating legacy Code Dx Kubernetes resources with Software Risk Manager ones. You can reuse your Code Dx license when prompted for a Software Risk Manager Web license.

Address any warnings or instructions printed by the migration script. When complete, invoke the generated run-helm-prep.ps1 file to stage the resources required for your Software Risk Manager deployment.

## Install Software Risk Manager

Invoke the run-helm-prep.ps1 script generated by your run-migrate.ps1 script, which you will find in the new work directory you specified. 

```
$ pwsh /path/to/run-helm-prep.ps1
```

Follow the instructions printed by run-helm-prep.ps1 and wait for Software Risk Manager to come online before continuing to the next section to import your Code Dx data into Software Risk Manager.

## Stop Software Risk Manager Web

Wait for all Software Risk Manager pods to reach a ready state before stopping Software Risk Manager workloads. You must turn off the Software Risk Manager Web workload, leaving it offline during the migration process.

1) Scale down your destination Software Risk Manager Web workload, replacing the `srm` namespace and `srm-web` deployment name as necessary:

```
$ kubectl -n srm scale --replicas=0 deployment/srm-web
```

## Stop Software Risk Manager Tool Orchestration (if installed)

1) Scale down your destination Software Risk Manager Tool Orchestration instance, replacing the `srm` namespace, `srm-to` and `srm-minio` deployment names as necessary:

```
$ kubectl -n srm scale --replicas=0 deployment/srm-to
$ kubectl -n srm scale --replicas=0 deployment/srm-minio
```

## Work Directory

You will be copying files between remote pods and your local system, so start by switching to a local directory with sufficient disk space. We'll refer to this directory as your work directory.

```
$ cd /path/to/local/work/directory
```

## Copy Code Dx Web Files Locally

You must copy data from your Code Dx Web volume(s) to your Software Risk Manager Web volume. 

1) Save the following content to a file named host-code-dx-appdata-volume.yaml in /path/to/local/work/directory, replacing the `cdx-app` namespace, `codedx/codedx-tomcat:v2023.8.0` Docker image name (with the version you are running), and `codedx-appdata` volume name as necessary:

>Note: You can find your Code Dx AppData volume name with this command, replacing the `cdx-app` namespace as necessary: kubectl -n cdx-app get pvc

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: host-code-dx-appdata-volume
  namespace: cdx-app
spec:
  containers:

## Backup Code Dx Database

You must create a database backup from either your on-cluster MariaDB database or your external database.

### Backup On-Cluster MariaDB Database

Skip this section if you are using an external database.

1) Run the following commands to create a logical backup, replacing the `cdx-app` namespace and `codedx-mariadb-master-0` pod name as necessary:

```
$ kubectl -n cdx-app exec -it codedx-mariadb-master-0 -- bash
$ mysqldump --host=127.0.0.1 --port=3306 --user=root -p codedx > /bitnami/mariadb/dump-codedx.sql
$ # verify "Dump completed" message (see Note 2)
$ tail -n 1 /bitnami/mariadb/dump-codedx.sql
$ cd /bitnami/mariadb
$ tar -cvzf dump-codedx.tgz dump-codedx.sql
$ rm dump-codedx.sql
$ exit # bash
```

>Note 1: The above command assumes you have adequate space at /bitnami/mariadb to store your database backup; expand your data volume if you need more disk capacity.

>Note 2: Confirm that your dump file ends with a "Dump completed" message (e.g., tail -n 1 /bitnami/mariadb/dump-codedx.sql), and consider performing a restore test to another catalog on the same database instance where you can compare tables/data.

2) Copy dump-codedx.sql to your local work directory with the following commands, replacing the `cdx-app` namespace and `codedx-mariadb-master-0` pod name as necessary:

```
$ cd /path/to/local/work/directory
$ kubectl -n cdx-app cp codedx-mariadb-master-0:/bitnami/mariadb/dump-codedx.tgz dump-codedx.tgz
```

### Backup External Database

Skip this section if you are using an on-cluster MariaDB database.

1) Log on to your external database host and use mysqldump to create a logical backup, replacing the host, port, user, and database parameters as necessary.

```
$ mysqldump --host=127.0.0.1 --port=3306 --user=admin -p codedxdb > dump-codedx.sql
```

>Note: Confirm that your dump file ends with a "Dump completed" message (e.g., tail -n 1 dump-codedx.sql), and consider performing a restore test to another catalog on the same database instance where you can compare tables/data.

2) Copy dump-codedx.sql to your local work directory.

## Restore Code Dx Database

You must restore a database backup to either your on-cluster MariaDB database or your external database.

### Restore On-Cluster MariaDB Database

Skip this section if you are using an external database.

Restore the database backup from your local system by running the restore-db.ps1 script, replacing placeholder parameter values:

>Note: The -backupToRestore parameter value must not include a colon character

```
$ cd /path/to/local/work/directory
$ pwsh /path/to/git/srm-k8s/admin/db/restore-db-logical.ps1 -backupToRestore './dump-codedx.tgz' -rootPwd '<srm-db-root-pwd>' -replicationPwd '<srm-db-repl-pwd>' -namespace '<srm-namespace>' -releaseName '<srm-release-name>' -waitSeconds 600 -skipSRMWebRestart
```

### Restore External Database

Skip this section if you are using an on-cluster MariaDB database.

Run a mysql command similiar to the following to import your logical backup, replacing the `admin` username, hostname, and `srmdb` database placeholders as necessary:

```
$ sed 's/\sDEFINER=`[^`]*`@`[^`]*`//g' -i dump-codedx.sql
$ mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -uadmin -p srmdb < dump-codedx.sql
```

>Note: If you see the `Access denied; you need (at least one of) the SUPER, SET USER privilege(s) for this operation` error message, confirm that you ran the `sed` command above.

# Cannot Run PowerShell Core

Running the Helm Prep Wizard and Helm Prep Script is the recommended deployment method when the Quick Start installation is not applicable. The Helm Prep Wizard is a one-time step, and the Helm Prep Script helps ensure that your Kubernetes resources and Helm values files are correctly defined. Rerunning the Helm Prep Script on upgrade helps ensure your deployment works with any required chart changes associated with a new Software Risk Manager version. 

Running the scripts in an alternate environment can help you stage your helm deployment if you cannot run PowerShell Core in your primary environment. Alternatively, consider running the scripts from a Docker container:

```
$ docker run -it --rm mcr.microsoft.com/powershell bash
$ apt update

$ # install git
$ apt install -y git

$ # install Java
$ apt install -y wget apt-transport-https
$ mkdir -p /etc/apt/keyrings
$ wget -O - https://packages.adoptium.net/artifactory/api/gpg/key/public | tee /etc/apt/keyrings/adoptium.asc
$ echo "deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/adoptium.asc] https://packages.adoptium.net/artifactory/deb $(awk -F= '/^VERSION_CODENAME/{print$2}' /etc/os-release) main" | tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/adoptium.list
$ apt update
$ apt install -y temurin-11-jdk

$ # install kubectl (specify correct version for your cluster)
$ apt install -y curl
$ curl -L https://dl.k8s.io/release/v1.28.4/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl -o /usr/local/bin/kubectl
$ chmod +x /usr/local/bin/kubectl

$ # start Helm Prep Wizard
$ git clone https://github.com/synopsys-sig/srm-k8s
$ cd srm-k8s
$ pwsh ./helm-prep-wizard.ps1

$ # run Helm Prep Script
$ pwsh "/root/.k8s-srm/run-helm-prep.ps1"
```

# Software Risk Manager Helm Chart

# Uninstall

You can remove Software Risk Manager by running the following commands, replacing release name and Kubernetes namespace as necessary:

```
$ helm -n srm delete srm
$ kubectl delete ns srm
```

>Note: A helm hook may run on uninstall to clean up Tool Orchestration objects. You can bypass the workflow clean-up process by adding the --no-hooks parameter: helm -n srm delete srm --no-hooks

Delete any remaining Persistent Volumes (PV) and any related PV data.

# Troubleshooting

Refer to these sections for troubleshooting guidance.

## Core Feature Troubleshooting

This section includes troubleshooting guidance for the Core feature.

### Table Already Exists

Each boot of the Software Risk Manager web component tests whether database schema updates are required. The initial boot provisions the entire database schema, marking successful provisioning by creating a new `.installation` file in the root AppData directory mounted at `/opt/codedx`. Future boots will skip initial provisioning and test whether schema updates are required.

Software Risk Manager treats a missing `/opt/codedx/.installation` as a scenario where the web database schema does not exist. An attempt to provision a database schema where one already exists will generate an error in the Software Risk Manager log that looks like this:

```

```

This error typically occurs when Software Risk Manager gets installed following an uninstall. Common causes are inadvertently reusing an existing Persistent Volume with the on-cluster MariaDB database or forgetting to recreate the database catalog in an external database. In both cases, a new web volume is missing the `.installation` file, so the web component attempts to provision a schema where one already exists, generating the table-already-exists message.

The safest way to resolve this issue is to ensure a blank database catalog before attempting a helm deployment (this resolution would not apply to existing deployments with data you do not want to lose). For on-cluster database configurations, refer to the [uninstall instructions](#uninstall) that mention removing related Persistent Volume resources. For external database configurations, drop the database catalog (e.g., `DROP DATABASE srmdb;`) before following Steps 2 and 3 of the [external database pre-work instructions](#external-web-database-pre-work) (you can reuse the same database user).

Alternatively, if you are confident that your database schema was provisioned entirely, you can create the `.installation` file by hand, but you must understand the root cause of your missing `.installation` file. Recreating the file is okay if it got inadvertently deleted; however, other circumstances may require additional intervention. For example, suppose you lost your entire web volume. In that case, you will be missing files related to what's in your database, like analysis inputs and support files required to interpret specific database records. If your troubleshooting ends up auto-generating new passwords, you will need to restore the original admin password (see the [update the admin password](#software-risk-manager-admin-password-reset) instructions). To manually create your `.installation` file, do the following, replacing the namespace and deployment names as required:

```
# exec into the pod
kubectl -n srm exec -c srm -it deployment/srm-web -- bash

# change directory
cd /opt/codedx

# create .installation file
cat << EOF > .installation
installed.on=$(date | sed s/\:/\\\\:/g)
EOF

# restart the replicas
kubectl -n srm scale --replicas=0 deployment/srm-web
kubectl -n srm scale --replicas=1 deployment/srm-web
```

When the web workload reboots, the new `/opt/codedx/.installation` file will cause the web workload to skip initial database provisioning.

### RSA Public Key Unavailable

Using an external database with TLS is recommended. If you are using an unencrypted connection to an external MySQL database with the `caching_sha2_password` default_authentication_plugin, you might see the following error in the Software Risk Manager log:

```
java.sql.SQLException: Could not connect to address=(host=mysql)(port=3306)(type=master) : RSA public key is not available client side (option serverRsaPublicKeyFile not set)
```

You can resolve the above issue by following the [Specify MySQL Server Public Key Path](#specify-mysql-server-public-key-path) instructions.

## Scan Farm Feature Troubleshooting

This section includes troubleshooting guidance for the Scan Farm feature.

### Scan Farm Migration Job Fails

A misconfiguration could cause a Scan Farm migration job to fail. The job's restartPolicy is "on-failure," so the related container gets removed, making the logs hard to grab from the command line. If you have something collecting generated logs on your cluster, you should be able to troubleshoot from that output. Otherwise, you can edit the Scan Farm chart directly by switching the restartPolicy for the job to Never.

The Scan Farm chart does not include a helm value setting for the job's restart policy, so you have to edit the chart locally like this:

```
$ cd /path/to/git/srm-k8s/chart/charts
$ tar xvf cnc-2024.3.0.tgz
$ vim cnc/templates/cnc-scan-service.yaml # set job's restartPolicy to Never
$ mv cnc-2024.3.0.tgz ~ # move original chart elsewhere
$ helm package cnc # recreate cnc-2024.3.0.tgz
$ rm -r cnc # delete working chart
```

>Note: The above procedure uses the "cnc" dependency chart version 2024.3.0.

Avoid rerunning the `helm dependency update` command until you have inspected the job pod's log and have resolved the problem.

## Helm TLS Values (values-tls.yaml)

When you run the Helm Prep Wizard and enable TLS via cert-manager on the Configure TLS screen, the wizard will include an installation note referencing the below pre-work from the values-tls.yaml file. You must run the applicable commands below before running the helm command generated by the Helm Prep Script.

The [next section](#bash-and-powershell-commands) contains initial Bash shell commands followed by PowerShell commands. If you do not have Bash available, refer to the [following section](#powershell-commands) for a procedure that only uses PowerShell commands.

## Helm Chart Notes

This section describes important considerations when moving from one SRM Helm chart version to another. If you deployed with the [Full Installation Instructions](#installation---full) instructions, rerunning the Helm Prep Script with your config.json and following the generated instructions will simplify the upgrade process. If you deployed with the [Quick Start Installation Instructions](#installation---quick-start), use the sections below to guide your update.

### Upgrading to v1.22 - v1.25

These chart versions depend on an updated Scan Farm chart with a list of Docker images that differ from the previous version.

- Scan Farm users should note the [changes to the list of Docker images](https://github.com/synopsys-sig/srm-k8s/commit/40de24a7ebb1cc96a8eb0f0660b652ae00c8c523#diff-af237e092dd7904bc46102ce0fd5f2986aacb50543ef5a558db6df195fe119b6) you must copy to your private registry.

### Upgrading to v1.26

This chart version switches the Tool Orchestration feature's Argo dependency from v2 to v3. 

>Note: The Helm Prep Script will handle Argo-related chart configuration adjustments. If you previously deployed using the script, rerun the latest script version and follow its instructions.

- The Argo chart dependency is named `argo-workflow` instead of `argo`, and the related repository is `https://argoproj.github.io/argo-helm` instead of `https://codedx.github.io/codedx-kubernetes`. Any chart customizations referring to `argo` should instead refer to `argo-workflows`. Run the following commands to drop the `argo` repository and add the `argo-workflow` one:

```
helm repo remove argo
helm repo add argo-workflows https://argoproj.github.io/argo-helm --force-update
```

>Note: Visit the [argo-workflows](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-helm/tree/main/charts/argo-workflows) site to ensure any custom overrides you may have added are valid for Argo v3.

- Argo v3 uses newer versions of the Argo Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs); run `kubectl apply` on the latest [CRD files](https://github.com/synopsys-sig/srm-k8s/tree/main/crds/v1) to update your Argo v2 CRD definitions. Run the following command to update your Argo CRDs:

```
kubectl apply -f /path/to/git/srm-k8s/crds/v1
```

- The Argo v3 chart creates a workflow ServiceAccount resource in a namespace specified using the `argo-workflows.controller.workflowNamespaces` array Helm value.

```
argo-workflows:
  controller:
    workflowNamespaces
    - srm
```

- Tool Orchestration deployments with TLS support provided by cert-manager require an extra [TLS Pre-work](#tls-pre-work) step. The extra CA Kubernetes Secret, which has the same name as the currently required Kubernetes ConfigMap, is necessary for workflows to access object storage when the storage is protected by a cert that was not issued by a well-known CA. Run the following command after updating the variable values for your deployment:

```
kubectl -n $SRM_NAMESPACE create secret generic $CA_CONFIGMAP_NAME --from-file ca.crt=ca.crt
```

- Add-in TOML files now support a `request.volume` subtable with the following fields:

```
[request.volume]
mountPoint = "/opt/data"
storageCapacity = "2Gi"
storageClassName = "name"
```

>Note: For backward compatibility, the DataDirectory, DataDirectoryStorageCapacity, and DataDirectoryStorageClassName fields of the request table are still supported.

- Add-in TOML files now supports a `request.podsecuritycontext` subtable with the following fields:

```
[request.podsecuritycontext]
runAsUser = 1000
runAsGroup = 1000
fsGroup = 1000
```

>Note: For backward compatibility, the DataDirectoryFileSystemGroup field of the request table is still supported.

### Upgrading to v1.28

This chart version replaces the `codedx/codedx-argoexec` and `codedx/codedx-workflow-controller` Docker images with `argoproj/argoexec` and `argoproj/workflow-controller`.
